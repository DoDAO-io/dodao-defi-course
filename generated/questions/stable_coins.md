##### What is a stablecoin?  

- [ ]  A shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a network.
- [x]  A stablecoin is a digital currency that is pegged to a stable reserve asset
- [ ]  A generally accepted form of payment usually issued by a government and circulated within its jurisdiction.
- [ ]  A form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers.
  
Hint: Stable cryptocurrency
         
Explanation: A stablecoin is a digital currency that is pegged to a “stable” reserve asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. Using the value of an underlying asset, such as the U.S. dollar, stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that aim to keep their price stable over time.

Hint: stable and decentralized
         
Explanation: A stablecoin is a digital currency that is pegged to a “stable” reserve asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. They are designed to reduce volatility relative to unpegged cryptocurrencies. They are open, worldwide, and available to everyone on the internet at any time.

- [ ]  Slow transfer speed
- [x]  Less volatility
- [x]  Global processing
- [ ]  None of the above
  
Hint: quick and cheap
         
Explanation: Stablecoins are open, worldwide, and available to everyone on the internet at any time. They transmit quickly, cheaply, and securely.

##### Which of the following are pillars of stablecoin trilemma?  

- [ ]  Price stability, Centralization, and Capital efficiency.
- [ ]  Price volatility, Decentralization, and Capital inefficiency.
- [x]  Price stability, Decentralization, and Capital efficiency.
- [ ]  Price stability, Decentralization, and Capital inefficiency.
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: A stablecoin must strike a balance between three major objectives, namely, price stability, decentralization, and capital efficiency.

Sub Topics: types
 

---

##### What is the principal objective of a stablecoin?  

- [x]  Price stability
- [ ]  Decentralization
- [ ]  Low transfer fees
- [ ]  Quick transaction
  
Hint: Stablecoins already inherit the properties of cryptocurrency
         
Explanation: A stablecoin's principal objective and goal are to maintain a stable value correlated to the value of another asset, such as a fiat currency.

Sub Topics: types
 

---

##### What is the inherent property of trilemma?  

- [ ]  All of the three objectives can be accomplished concurrently
- [x]  None of the three objectives can ever be accomplished concurrently
- [ ]  Only one of the three objectives can ever be accomplished
- [ ]  None of the three objectives can ever be accomplished
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: A trilemma's inherent property is that none of the three objectives can ever be accomplished concurrently. As the majority of stablecoin designs trade off either the system's decentralization or its capital efficiency in order to attain great price stability.

##### Pick the correct statement(s).  

- [x]  Each stablecoin makes a significant concession in one of the other two dimensions of the trilemma.
- [x]  The peg has been held pretty successfully over the past few years by some stablecoins like USDC, DAI, USDT etc.
- [ ]  The peg has been uncontrollable over the past few years by stablecoins.
- [ ]  Each stablecoin follows all the dimensions of the stablecoin trilemma.
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: The peg has been held pretty successfully over the past few years by centralized fiat-backed & decentralized overcollateralized stablecoins. However, each makes a significant concession in one of the other two dimensions of the trilemma. So far, a wide range of design strategies has been used to address the trilemma and attain all three desired features but were unsuccessful.

##### Some of these algorithmic stablecoins were able to solve the trilemma. Do you agree with this statement?  

- [ ]  Yes, they have totally solved the stablecoin trilemma and continue to do so.
- [x]  Yes, but only for a brief period of time until the market's workings once more exposed their weaknesses.
- [ ]  No, they were unable to solve the stablecoin trilemma.
- [ ]  Can not say anything.

##### What were the reasons that helped MakerDAO's DAI gain popularity?  

- [x]  Conventional fiat-backed stablecoin issuer needs a centralized banking system in order to back the token with real Fiat money
- [ ]  The level of decentralization was high in fiat-backed stablecoins
- [x]  Some fiat-backed stablecoins lacked information on the fiat reserves held in bank accounts
- [ ]  None of the above
  
Hint: centralization and nontransparent
         
Explanation: Conventional fiat-backed stablecoin issuer needs a centralized banking system in order to back the token with real Fiat money, such as USD. The level of centralization that resulted, together with the fact that some fiat-backed stablecoins lacked information on the fiat reserves held in bank accounts, helped on-chain and crypto-backed stablecoins like MakerDAO's Dai to take off.

Hint: Disadvantages related to transparency and centralization
         
Explanation: Fiat-backed stablecoins are centralized i.e. governments can interfere and seize the assets of fiat-backed stablecoin suppliers, in unprecedented situations. Requires auditing to ensure the company has sufficient reserves. Suppliers' can have lack of transparency and accountability. Customers must go through an AML and KYC process in order to borrow stablecoins against USD

##### Which strategy is used to handle the fluctuations of underlying crypto in crypto-backed stablecoins?  

- [ ]  Undercollateralization
- [x]  Overcollateralization
- [ ]  Decentralization
- [ ]  Centralization
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Because the underlying crypto's value can fluctuate, these stablecoins are overcollateralized to ensure the price stays as stable as possible.

Sub Topics: crypto-backed

##### Suppose a stablecoin with a crypto asset backing is around $1. What would be the value of underlying asset?  

- [ ]  $1
- [ ]  $0.1
- [ ]  $0.01
- [x]  $2
  
Hint: Overcollateralization
         
Explanation: Because the underlying crypto's value can fluctuate, these stablecoins are overcollateralized to ensure the price stays as stable as possible. This makes it more accurate to state that a stablecoin with a crypto asset backing of $1 has an underlying asset worth at least $2.

Sub Topics: crypto-backed
 

---

##### If crypto prices fall, what should be done to ensure the stability crypto-backed stablecoin?  

- [ ]  Less crypto must be used to back the stablecoin
- [x]  More crypto must be used to back the stablecoin
- [ ]  Crypto amount used to back the stablecoin should remain same
- [ ]  Crypto amount used to back the stablecoin should be halfed
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Because the underlying crypto's value can fluctuate, these stablecoins are overcollateralized to ensure the price stays as stable as possible. Therefore, if crypto prices fall, more crypto must be used to back the stablecoin, otherwise, the stablecoins' value would decrease.

##### Choose the correct statement(s) about Rebase Algorithmic Stablecoins.  

- [x]  If the token's price falls below the price of the fiat currency it follows, an algorithmic stablecoin system burns the supply in circulation.
- [ ]  If the token's price falls below the price of the fiat currency it follows, an algorithmic stablecoin system mints the supply in circulation.
- [x]  If the token's price exceeds the price of the fiat currency it follows, fresh tokens are added to the circulation to reduce the stablecoin's value.
- [ ]  If the token's price exceeds the price of the fiat currency it follows, fresh tokens are burned from the circulation to reduce the stablecoin's value.
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Since there is no other asset backing these stablecoins, if the price drops below the targeted level, an algorithm will sell tokens, and if the price rises above the acceptable level, it will supply tokens.

Sub Topics: algorithmic
 

---

##### How does the algorithm balances a two-token model?  

- [ ]  Using Overcollateralization
- [ ]  Using Undercollateralization
- [ ]  Using Off-chain collateral
- [x]  Using Mint and Burn Mechanism
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: The value of a second token serves as collateral for the stablecoin. Usually, an algorithm balances this two-token model with a mint and burn mechanism for the second token.

- [ ]  Sells existing price-floating token
- [ ]  Burns existing price-floating token
- [x]  Creates new price-floating token
- [ ]  Does not do anything
  
Hint: supplies more
         
Explanation: In the event that investors choose to sell-off their stablecoins, the protocol creates a new price-floating token while the stablecoin supply fluctuates.
