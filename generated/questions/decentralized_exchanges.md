Hint: There are 2 types of crypto exchange
         
Explanation: There are 2 types of crypto-exchange in which one uses the Order-Book Model & governed by a central authority (known as Traditional or Centralized Exchange) and the other uses Automated Market Maker i.e not governed by any central authority (known as Decentralized Exchange)

Sub Topics: intro

##### What is a Centralized Exchange?  

- [ ]  A peer-exchange-peer marketplace for crypto traders without any intermediary intervention
- [x]  A peer-to-exchange-to-peer marketplace where transactions between crypto traders are done using traditional “Order Book” models that are officiated by banks, brokers, or any other intermediary.
- [ ]  A marketplace where securities, commodities, derivatives, and other financial instruments are traded
- [ ]  A peer-to-peer marketplace for crypto traders without any intermediary intervention
  
Hint: Buyer-Exchange platform/marketplace-Seller

##### Centralized Exchange with Server Order Book Model has  

- [x]  Faster trade matching and settlement
- [ ]  Slow trade matching and settlement
- [x]  No fees for cancelled orders
- [x]  No censorship resistance
  
Hint: Faster, Uncensored, Free cancelation
         
Explanation: Due to centralized governance they are faster as no validator/miner action is required in trade execution, and not to pay any gas fees for transactions hence, no fees are required for canceled orders, also all types of traders’ data are in the hand of a central authority so no censorship resistance.

##### Centralized Exchange with Onchain Order Book Model has  

- [x]  Slow trade matching and settlement
- [ ]  No fees for cancelled orders
- [ ]  No Censorship resistance
- [x]  Censorship resistance
  
Hint: Slower, Censored
         
Explanation: Due to the Decentralized and Distributed Ledger storage system they are slower as the validator/miner action is required in trade execution and have to pay gas fees for transactions hence, fees are required for canceled orders, also all types of traders’ data are censorship resistance.

##### What are the benefits of Decentralized exchanges over Centralized exchanges?  

- [x]  No KYC required
- [ ]  KYC
- [ ]  Fast matching
- [ ]  None of the above
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: In DEX we don't need to do any KYC nor have to pay any fees as it is governed by protocol and not by any centralized authority. But requires validation by the miners which takes time hence, the transaction little slower than Centralized Exchange.

Sub Topics: dex-definition

##### What are the major downsides of decentralized exchanges?  

- [ ]  No KYC/AML
- [x]  Fees for a deposit, withdrawal, trade creation/cancel
- [x]  Slow execution
- [ ]  No fees are paid to the exchange
  
Hint: Gas Fees and Slow transaction
         
Explanation: Due to security and validation by the miners of a transaction, we have to pay Gas fees even if the transaction gets failed which makes it slower than the Centralized Exchange.

##### The server book model has  

- [x]  Fast matching
- [ ]  Slow matching
- [ ]  Censorship resistance
- [x]  No fees for cancelled orders
  
Hint: Faster and No fees for cancelled orders
         
Explanation: As Server Book Model is governed by a central authority and not by any protocol it doesn't need any validation by any miners. Hence, are faster and don't need any fees for the failed transaction.

Sub Topics: crypto-exchange

##### Advantages of the on-chain order book model include  

- [x]  Censorship resistance
- [ ]  Fast matching
- [ ]  Gas or Blockchain fees for orders
- [ ]  No fees for cancelled orders
  
Hint: Censored personal data
         
Explanation: All the customers’ trading data, prices, and volumes of securities are stored on a Blockchain. Provide censorship resistance, as all data are stored on a distributed, and decentralized ledger in the form of immutable data blocks on the blockchain which are publicly shared among all its network nodes. Trade matching and settlement might be slow due to blockchain scalability issues.Fees are deducted in the form of Gas Fees for both successful and canceled orders. Miner/Trader/Exchange Operator can front-run users.

- [x]  All of the above
  
Hint: Protocol, Liquidity and Automated
         
Explanation: AMM is a type of DEX protocol that relies on a mathematical formula that allows digital assets to be traded without permission, automatically by using liquidity pools instead of the traditional order book pricing model.

Sub Topics: amm

##### Let's say, Asset X quantity * Asset Y quantity = K (a constant) in AMM then  

- [x]  Purchase of asset X increases the price of X and decreases the price of Y
- [ ]  Purchase of asset X increases the price of X and increases the price of Y
- [ ]  Purchase of asset X decreases the price of X and decreases the price of Y
- [ ]  Purchase of asset X does not affect the price of X and Y
  
Hint: X = K/Y
         
Explanation: The ratio of assets X and Y set the price of the pool as the purchase of asset X increases the price of X and decreases the price of Y and vice-versa.

Sub Topics: amm
 

---

##### Properties of a Constant Product AMM are  

- [ ]  Instant liquidity, irrespective of the trade size (assuming that trade size is always less than pool size).
- [ ]  The ratio of assets X and Y sets the price of the pool.
- [ ]  Purchase of asset X increases the price of X and decreases the price of Y
- [x]  All of the above
  
Hint: Quick Liquidity, Ratio of X and Y set price and purchase of one affect other's price.
         
Explanation: Asset X quantity * Asset Y quantity = K (a constant) or simply  X*Y=K. Hence, provides:- 1) Instant liquidity, irrespective of the trade size. 2) Purchase of asset X increases the price of X and decreases the price of Y. 3) The ratio of assets X and Y sets the price

- [ ]  Deviating
- [ ]  Pegging

Explanation: De-pegging refers to the phenomenon of a stablecoin deviating or any asset deviating from its intended peg. For example:- In the case of a stablecoin pegged to USD, if its value reduces below $1, then the coin is said to be “de-pegged” which indirectly reduces the valuation of investment to a Liquidity Pool by a Liquidity Provider.

##### Flash loan and flash swap are the same  

- [ ]  true
- [x]  false
  
Hint: One is Loan and other is Exchanged value
         
Explanation: Flash Swaps allows us to withdraw up to the full reserves of any ERC20 token on Uniswap and execute arbitrary logic at no upfront cost, provided that by the end of the transaction you either- 1) Pay for the withdrawn ERC20 tokens with the corresponding pair tokens, 2) Return the withdrawn ERC20 tokens along with a small fee. Whereas th Flash Loan is a loan which we have to take and repay back in one transaction.

##### Impermanent loss is realized upon  

- [ ]  Deposit only
- [ ]  Deposit as well as withdrawal
- [ ]  Holding only
- [x]  Withdrawal only
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Impermanent loss == Not Permanent Loss. Loss generated due to price change of the asset which is realized upon withdrawal only. So, it can result in a total loss of value but- Trading fees taken from the traders may compensate for it and Liquidity mining reward may compensate for it.
