##### Advantages of the on-chain order book model include  

- [x]  Censorship resistance
- [ ]  Fast matching
- [ ]  Gas or Blockchain fees for orders
- [ ]  No fees for cancelled orders
  
Hint: Censored personal data
         
Explanation: All the customers’ trading data, prices, and volumes of securities are stored on a Blockchain. Provide censorship resistance, as all data are stored on a distributed, and decentralized ledger in the form of immutable data blocks on the blockchain which are publicly shared among all its network nodes. Trade matching and settlement might be slow due to blockchain scalability issues.Fees are deducted in the form of Gas Fees for both successful and canceled orders. Miner/Trader/Exchange Operator can front-run users.

- [x]  All of the above
  
Hint: Protocol, Liquidity and Automated
         
Explanation: AMM is a type of DEX protocol that relies on a mathematical formula that allows digital assets to be traded without permission, automatically by using liquidity pools instead of the traditional order book pricing model.

Sub Topics: automated-market-makers
 

---

##### Let's say, Asset X quantity * Asset Y quantity = K (a constant) in AMM then  

- [x]  Purchase of asset X increases the price of X and decreases the price of Y
- [ ]  Purchase of asset X increases the price of X and increases the price of Y

##### Flash loan and flash swap are the same  

- [ ]  True
- [x]  False
  
Hint: One is Loan and other is Exchanged value
         
Explanation: Flash Swaps allows us to withdraw up to the full reserves of any ERC20 token on Uniswap and execute arbitrary logic at no upfront cost, provided that by the end of the transaction you either- 1) Pay for the withdrawn ERC20 tokens with the corresponding pair tokens, 2) Return the withdrawn ERC20 tokens along with a small fee. Whereas th Flash Loan is a loan which we have to take and repay back in one transaction.

##### Impermanent loss is realized upon  

- [ ]  Deposit only
- [ ]  Deposit as well as withdrawal
- [ ]  Holding only
- [x]  Withdrawal only
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Impermanent loss == Not Permanent Loss. Loss generated due to price change of the asset which is realized upon withdrawal only. So, it can result in a total loss of value but- Trading fees taken from the traders may compensate for it and Liquidity mining reward may compensate for it.

##### Which of the following statements about Impermanent Loss are valid?  

- [x]  Impermanent Loss arises when the price ratio of an asset and liquidity pool changes.
- [ ]  This loss does not disappear when the prices of the tokens revert to the original value at which they were deposited.
- [x]  This loss disappears when the prices of the tokens revert to the original value at which they were deposited.
- [x]  Those who withdraw funds before the prices revert suffer permanent losses.
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Impermanent Loss arises when the price ratio of an asset and liquidity pool changes. So, Liquidity Providers (LPs) who have deposited funds in affected pools automatically incur this loss. The larger the shift in the price ratio the larger the loss. However, this loss is called impermanent for a reason as long as we do not withdraw deposited tokens at a time that the pool is experiencing a shift in price ratio it is still possible to mitigate the loss. This loss disappears when the prices of the tokens revert to the original value at which they were deposited. Those who withdraw funds before the prices revert suffer permanent losses.

##### Which of the following statements about Liquidity Pools are valid?  

- [x]  A Liquidity Pool is a collection of two asset pairs that are locked in a smart contract, to facilitate trading, borrowing, lending, yielding, etc.
- [x]  It ensures that buy and sell orders are carried out no matter the time of the day.
- [ ]  A Liquidity Pool is not funded by Liquidity Providers(LP).
- [x]  A Liquidity Pool is funded by Liquidity Providers(LP).
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: A Liquidity Pool is a collection of two asset pairs X and Y (Let’s say for example in the case of Constant Product AMM), funded by Liquidity Providers(LP), that are locked in a smart contract, to facilitate trading, borrowing, lending, yielding, etc. It ensures that buy and sell orders are carried out no matter the time of the day and at whatever price you want to trade without looking for any direct counterpart(as in the case of Order Book) as AMM ensures this. Hence, we won’t need to find a seller to buy a token. All that is needed is sufficient liquidity in the pool.
