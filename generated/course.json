Some of them are as listed below.\n\n- Centralized Control\n  * Centralised banking system is highly concentrated.\n  * National central banks controls currency\n  * Big Tech giants like Amazon, Facebook, Goolge provide non-financial centralization in the system.\n\n- Limited Access\n  * Around the globe there are more than 1.7 billion individuals who are unbanked.\n  * Billions of people are underbanked\n  * Many Entrepreneurs use credit cards to to finance their business, but banks won't lend them because they are small. This puts a negative impact on growth.\n\n- Inefficiency\n  * Banks charge 3% for a credit card swipe\n  * 5-7% is charged for a wire transfer\n  * It takes 2 days to settle a stock transaction\n  * Fund transfer is slow\n  * Banks are prone to frauds, chargebanks and lack security as well.\n  * Banks do not allow micro-transitions.\n  * It is difficult to get paid using banks.\n\n- Lack of Interoperability\n  * Institutions are isolated from each other and have no interlinking.\n  * It is difficult to move funds from one bank to another.\n  * Difficult to move money from a bank to non bank.\n  \n- Opacity\n  * Banking institutions have very little transparency.\n  * Bank customers do not know the health of the bank.\n  * Individuals are forced to rely on costly regulation and promise of bailouts.\n\n- High operating cost\n  * Banking institutions have high running cost due to accomodate large number of workers.\n\nThese problems when not tackled lead to following destructive effects.\n\n- Missed Growth Opportunities\n  * Entrepreneurs who have suppose 25% ROI on their great idea, but their project is not executed due to high cost of credit card borrowing.\n  * High ROI project fuels high CAPEX, strong real GDP growth, and robust employment growth.\n\n- Inequality of opportunities\n  * Projects should be financed based on the quality of the idea and the soundness of the execution plan.\n  * Many have no access to internet commerce (to buy or sell).\n  * Given the number of unbanked and underbanked, this creates unequal opportunities and perpetuates or even exacerbates inequality.\n"

          "details": "Centralised Finance opens up a wide range of advancement in the current centralised system.\n\n- Transfer of Money \n  * Using DeFi sending money would be as easy as sending an email.\n  * You just need to enter other persons account address and your payment will directly go into their account.\n\n- Stream money around the globe\n  * One can stream money over ethereum\n  * This lets you pay someone their salary by the second, giving them access to their money whenever they need it. Or rent something by the second like a storage locker or electric scooter.\n\n- Access to stablecoins\n  * Volatility in the cryptocurrency is of huge concern which hinders its growth as well.\n  * DeFi community has introduced stablecoins.\n  * Their value remains peggged to another asset, usually a popular currency like dollar.\n  * Coins like Dai or USDC have a value that stays within a few cents of a dollar.\n\n- Borrowing \n  * DeFi helps in borrowing money with privacy. \n  * The borrower must put up collateral that the lender will automatically receive if their loan is not repaid. \n  * This allows you to borrow money without credit checks or handing over private information.\n\n- Flash loans\n  * DeFi introduced the concept of flash loans where the borrower gets loans without handling any collateral to lender.\n  * If the borrower is not able to pay the loan, the transaction is reversed as if it never occured.\n\n- Tokenization\n  * DeFi introduces the concepts of crypto tokens.\n  * Ethereum enables robust smart contract capabilities, thereby opening up the roads for issuing crypto tokens. \n  * Crypto tokens basically worked as digital assets present on a blockchain alongside having different features and uses.\n  \n- Constant Updation \n  * Developers can build upon existing code because DeFi is open source.\n  * Easy to build applications/products (Cloud simplified creation of applications. Blockchain simplifies creation of financial apps)\n  * This helps in removing bugs and bring about great innovations in the existing system. \n"

They invented this technique for efficient time-stamping of digital documents.\n  * Adam Back in 2002 invents the idea of Proof of Work idea.\n  * Proof of Work was based on the paper work by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor (1992) that was aimed at eliminating junk mail.\n  * The sender needs to do some computational task before sending the mail. This was easy to do when done once but becomes infeasible to do for millions of recipients.\n  * Moreover, Blockchain is not Bitcoin rather Bitcoin employs the technology of Blockchain.  \n"

This ledger is quickly and easily accessbile by anyone and further shared by many which explains its distributive nature.\n  * These ledgers are responsible for process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.\n  * These are responsible for storing data and assets such as tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).\n  * Blockchain ledger is distributed. All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions.\n  * Due to this distributed mechanism the transactions are recorded only for once, eliminating the duplication of data something which is very frequent in traditional business mechanisms.\n  * Tampering or changing these transactions in the ledger is impossible for a particiapnt to do so.\n  * Thus, these records ensure proper immutability.\n\n- Blockchain Transactions and Blocks\n  * Whenever a transaction occurs it is stored as a \"block\" of data.\n  * These transactions show the movement of assets tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual).\n  * These data blocks store a variety of information such as who, what, when, where and also conditions such as temperature.\n  * Each block is connected to one before and after it. The blocks represent the flow of ownership of some data.\n  * Each of these blocks have a hashed reference to the block before it so you can trace every transaction all the way back to genesis block.\n  * These block are securely linked to each other to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.\n  * Blockchain hashes are highly secure. They strengthen the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain.\n"

Thus hashing creates great deal of security. \n\n- The Bad Effects\n  * Attackers who have fast hardware can easily \"crack\" hash values to original text.\n  * Good hash alogrithms are made to be collission resistant. But it is impossible to eliminate collissions completely. Algorithms like MD5 , SHA-1 are known to contain collsions-produce same hash value for two different input credentials.\n  * Rainbow tables are “optimized lookup tables” that can be used to reverse-engineer one-way hash functions. A rainbow table is basically a pre-computed set of plaintext strings and their corresponding hashes.\n  *  Large rainbow tables are publicly available, and attackers can use one of these tables to retrieve cleartext data that has been hashed.\n"

          "details": "- How Ethereum Transaction work?\n  * Transactions involve sending data and/or ETH (or other tokens)\n  from one address to another.\n  * An Ethereum user can control addresses through an externally\n  owned account (EOA) or by using smart contract code (contract\n  account).\n  * An EOA is controlled using a private key. It has no code incorporated within and it enables user to send transactions.\n  * When sending data to a contract account, the data are used to\n  execute code in that contract.\n  * Transactions sent to an externally owned account (EOA) can only transfer ETH.\n  * A single transaction starts with an end user from an EOA, but it can pass through many dApps (decentralised Applications) before completing.\n  * Transaction begins with a single smart contract and continues to carry on all the intermediate steps within the contract body.\n\n- Blockchain Transactions and Blocks\n  * Whenever a transaction occurs it is stored as a \"block\" of data.\n  * These transactions show the movement of assets tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual).\n  * These data blocks store a variety of information such as who, what, when, where and also conditions such as temperature.\n  * Each block is connected to one before and after it. The blocks represent the flow of ownership of some data.\n  * Each of these blocks have a hashed reference to the block before it so you can trace every transaction all the way back to genesis block.\n  * These block are securely linked to each other to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.\n  * Blockchain hashes are highly secure. They strengthen the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain.\n\n- Atomicity\n  * This is one of the most important property of Ethereum Transaction Mechanism which makes DeFi different from CeFi.\n  * The transactions in Ethereum are atomic which means the clauses in a smart contract can lead to failure of transaction and thus all the steps of the transaction are reversed.\n  * Atomicity enables inter-contract and inter-blockchain function calls that are synchronous and atomic by nature. This idea spans over the clauses in a smart contract, failure in any of them results in discarding of the whole transaction.\n  * Atomicity is a critical feature of transactions because funds can move between many contracts (i.e., “exchange hands”) with the knowledge and security that if one of the conditions is not met, the contract terms reset as if the money never left the starting point.\n"

          "details": "- Mempool\n  * Transactions are posted to a memory pool, or mempool, before\n  they are added to a block. \n  * Miners monitor these posted transactions, add them to their own\n  mempool, and share the transaction with other miners to be\n  included in the next available block.\n\n- Miner Extractable Value\n  * Any actor can see transactions in the mempool by running or communicating with mining nodes.\n  * This observation allows for front-running (legal in the DeFi space) to miners. If miner encounters a large order, they can plan their order before that, hence the miners are incentivised to do so.\n  * Miner extractable value (MEV) is a measure of the profit that the miner could make by including, excluding or re-ordering transactions. \n  * This is one of the drawback of the Proof of work consensus mechanism. Obfuscating transactions can mitigate MEV, thus hiding from miners how they might profit from transactions.\n"

          "key": "smartcontracts-gas-oracles",
          "details": "- Smart Contracts\n  * Ethereum is the example of most popular smart contract platform.\n  * A smart contract is code that can create and transform arbitrary data or\n  tokens on top of the blockchain of which it is a part.\n  * These are extremely powerful because it allows users to trustlessly encode\n  rules for any type of transaction and even create scarce assets with specialized functionality.\n  * Many standard business contracts can be algorithmically encoded and algorithmically enforced. These contracts run on the Ethereum blockchain and are run on every node.\n  * This is not just useful for finance. For example, supply chains are another good example.\n\n- Gas \n  * Gas is a unit that measures the amount of computational effort that it will take to execute certain operations.\n  * Transactions have a gas fee that is the fee received by the miners for conducting transactions.\n  * Transactions have a gas fee, which varies based on the complexity\n  of the transaction. E.g., low gas fee is used to compensate a miner\n  for including and executing a transaction, and high gas fee for\n  more data-intensive transactions.\n  * There are two types of contract interactions : real transactions and local static calls (view or readonly operartion). For example, transfer of money is a real transaction whereas checking account balance is readonly operation.Real transactions always cost gas, local static calls do not cost gas. This occurs majorly because the transactions bring about a change in the whole ethereum blockchain whereas the read only functions are issued to the local node. The local node does the computation with its own resources and its copy of the blockchain.\n  * If a transaction reverts due to any failure or runs out of gas the\n  miner forfeits all gas used until that point. This helps miners earn even if large volumes of failed transactions occur.\n\n  - Gas fees\n    * The gas price is determined by the market and effectively creates\n    an auction for inclusion in the next Ethereum block.\n    * Higher gas fees signal higher demand and therefore generally\n    receive higher priority for inclusion.\n  \n  - Gas Price \n    * Every operation on the Ethereum blockchain requires gas.\n    * Each unit of gas has a gas price, which is denoted in gwei. 1 gwei = 1\n      billionth of an ETH. Gas prices increase as users outbid one another\n      during times of higher network congestion.\n  \n  - Gas Limit\n    * The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas a user is willing to use for a\n    transaction. A transaction can include multiple operations.\n    * If there is residual amount of gas after the transaction is complete, then the user gets back the remaining gas.\n  \n  - Mining\n    * Ethereum currently uses the proof of work consensus mechanism.\n    * Ethereum miners - computers running software - using their time and computation power to process transactions and produce blocks.\n    * Gas fees are used to compensate Ethereum miners for their work in verifying transactions and securing the network.\n\n  - Turing Complete\n    * Gas plays a very important role. If a malicious attack is planned then it would be extremely expensive to carry out.\n    * Ethereum is turing complete whereas Bitcoin is not.\n\n- Oracles\n  * Ethereum blockchain nows only of what happens inside the Blockchain. But how does it get the information needed from the outside world? Here Oracles come into play.\n  * An oracle, in the context of smart contract platforms, is any data source for reporting information external to the blockchain. \n\n  - Oracle Problem\n    * This refers to the correctness of the off-chain information that is provided by the oracle.\n    * One Ethereum-based platform known as Chainlink is designed to solve the\n    oracle problem by using an aggregation of data sources. The Chainlink\n    whitepaper includes a reputation-based system that is decentralized.\n\n  \n"

Instead of asset ownership,\n    governance token ownership applies to voting rights.\n    * Any platform with admin-controlled functionality is not truly DeFi\n    because of the admins’ centralized control. For this reason, many platforms strive for a decentralized upgrade process, often mediated by a governance token.\n    * UNI token introduced by Uniswap DEX, is a type of governance token which used, as voting rights whenever there is a need to incorporate an upgrade in the existing mechanism of exchange.\n\n- ERC-721 (Ethereum Request for Comment 721)\n  * ERC-721 defines the non-fungible standard. It is similar to ERC-20 except that each unit has its own unique ID.\n  * NFTs act as a  representation for unique ownership of unitary assets.\n  * NFTs can be used to represent collectibles (eg. onwership of a piece of art).\n\n- ERC 1155\n  * ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens require an individual contract and address deployed to the blockchain.\n  * Due to different requirements of fungible and non fungible tokens it can be cumbersome for system.\n  * ERC-1155 resolves this complexity by defining a multi-token model in which the contract holds balances for a variable number of tokens, which can be fungible or nonfungible.\n\n  \n"

But thee are many user cases for it.\n  * **Yield Farming** - The process involves leveraging DeFi protocols to lend cryptocurrencies for high returns that can \n    go up to 100% in annualized yields. Yield farming originates from banks’ process in lending your deposits; the difference \n    is that DeFi yield farming compounds the interest earned.\n  * **Arbitrage** - Arbitrage takes advantage of the fact that an asset may be worth more in one market than another. While \n    this usually happens because of market inefficiencies, it can also be used to exploit differences in rates between \n    different platforms.\n  * **Margin Trading (Leverage)** - Taking out a loan with extra collateral can help you gain leverage, and you can repeat \n    the process until you reach the limit.\n  * **Liquidation** - Liquidations can be quite profitable, especially for tech-savvy traders. Usually, a liquidator has to \n    compete against other people for the same job, so he uses bots. They work by \"sniping\" the loans that are under the \n    collateralization ratio. This way, they can liquidate the collateral and reimburse the lender. In turn, the liquidator \n    receives a reward fee for his services.\n  * **Risk-reduction/Hedging** - No matter how well you think you know the markets, there will always be bumps in the road. As \n    a trader, you need to find ways to protect your investment from risk, and this is where crypto hedging strategies come in. \n    Hedging encompasses opening positions in opposing market directions to reduce the risks and impacts of market swings. By doing this, \n    you can help to offset any potential losses that might occur.\n"

          "details": "- Traditional or Centralized Exchange (CEX):\n  * A centralized crypto exchange is one that's created and run by a company. These exchanges are considered centralized because one company oversees all the transactions and sets the exchange's rules and fees.\n  * Transactions are done using traditional “Order Book” models that are officiated by banks, brokers, or any other intermediary.\n  * Customer data(such as KYC) and transactional data are stored by a company.\n  * For example, Coinbase, Crypto.com and FTX create and run popular CEXes for a profit.\n  * Now, What is an “Order Book”?\n    * An order book is a list of orders that presents different offers from buyers and sellers for a specific security.\n    * It also shows the prices and volumes that people in the market are willing to buy and sell the security for.\n  * There are two types of CEX based on the order book model:\n    - CEX with Server Order Book model:\n      * All the customers’ trading data, prices, and volumes of securities are stored in a Centralized Server.\n      * Trade matching and settlement are faster.\n      * No fees are deducted for canceled orders.\n      * No censorship resistance as all data are stored on a centralized server.\n      * Exchange operators can front-run customers.\n\n    - CEX with Onchain Order Book model\n      * All the customers’ trading data, prices, and volumes of securities are stored on a Blockchain.\n      * Provide censorship resistance, as all data are stored on a distributed, and decentralized ledger in the form of immutable data blocks on the blockchain which are publicly shared among all its network nodes.\n      * Trade matching and settlement might be slow due to blockchain scalability issues.\n      * Fees are deducted in the form of Gas Fees for both successful and canceled orders.\n      * Miner/Trader/Exchange Operator can front-run users.\n"

          "details": "- Automated Market Maker (AMM):\n  * AMM is a type of DEX protocol that relies on a mathematical formula that allows digital assets to be traded without permission, automatically by using liquidity pools instead of the traditional order book pricing model. This formula can vary with each protocol. For example, Uniswap uses the Constant Product AMM protocol which is as follows:-\n    * Asset X quantity * Asset Y quantity = K (a constant)  simply  X*Y=K\n      * Properties of popular Constant Product AMM protocol:\n        * Instant liquidity, irrespective of the trade size (assuming that trade size is always less than pool size).\n        * Purchase of asset X increases the price of X and decreases the price of Y\n        * The ratio of assets X and Y sets the price\n    * Now, What is a Protocol?\n      * Protocols are basic sets of rules that allow data and cryptocurrencies to be shared securely between different nodes (i.e computers) in the blockchain network.\n    - Pros of an AMM:\n        * No Order Book Maintenance for traders but arbitrage is required for them.\n        * A simple implementation of Constant Product AMM causes less computation which results in Low gas costs.\n    - Cons of an AMM:\n        * The danger of Impermanent loss/Coin De-Pegg may cause a total possible loss of funds in Liquidity Pools.\n        * High slippage for low liquidity markets. So, please do observe and set your slippage tolerance threshold level while trading.\n"

          "details": "- Liquidity Pool and its Working:-\n  * A Liquidity Pool is a collection of two asset pairs X and Y (Let’s say for example in the case of Constant Product AMM), funded by Liquidity Providers(LP), that are locked in a smart contract, to facilitate trading, borrowing, lending, yielding, etc.\n  * It ensures that buy and sell orders are carried out no matter the time of the day and at whatever price you want to trade without looking for any direct counterpart(as in the case of Order Book) as AMM ensures this. Hence, we won’t need to find a seller to buy a token. All that is needed is sufficient liquidity in the pool.\n  * When a token swap occurs, the AMM ensures that the price adjusts based on its algorithm. The algorithm ensures that there is always liquidity in the pool, no matter the trade size. \n  * For eg., A liquidity pool is, by default, a 50:50 ratio of 2 coins. Let's say 50% dai (DAI) and 50% ether (ETH). When you buy DAI with ETH, the pools will start to lose DAI and get more ETH. The algorithm increases the price of dai and lowers the price of ether to keep the ratio regulated. The process is a self-regulated automated reaction to the market's needs.  \n"

          "details": "- Types of rewards that Liquidity Providers get on funding Liquidity Pools are:\n  - Trading Fees reward: that are paid by traders on each trade( eg, 0.03% in Curve.fi )\n  - Liquidity Mining reward:\n    * It is an incentive/reward given to the Liquidity Providers(LP) proportional to the amount of liquidity provided by the LP\n    * It can also be provided to the LPs in terms of “Airdrops”.\n    * Airdrops are tokens that are given to the traders and LPs for free or in exchange for minimal promotional work.\n- Types of losses for Liquidity Providers:\n  - Impermanent loss == Not Permanent Loss\n    * Impermanent Loss arises when the price ratio of an asset and liquidity pool changes. So, Liquidity Providers (LPs) who have deposited funds in affected pools automatically incur this loss. The larger the shift in the price ratio the larger the loss.\n    * However, this loss is called impermanent for a reason as long as we do not withdraw deposited tokens at a time that the pool is experiencing a shift in price ratio it is still possible to mitigate the loss.\n    * This loss disappears when the prices of the tokens revert to the original value at which they were deposited.\n    * Those who withdraw funds before the prices revert suffer permanent losses.\n    - Nonetheless, it is possible to negate the losses through income received by liquidity providers via:\n      * Trading fees (i.e fees taken from traders during each trading transaction).\n      * Liquidity mining reward (i.e reward given by the DEX in the form of its governance tokens or some other asset as interests).\n  - Coin de-peg:\n    * De-pegging refers to the phenomenon of a stablecoin deviating or any asset deviating from its intended peg. For example: In the case of a stablecoin pegged to USD, if its value reduces below $1, then the coin is said to be “de-pegged” which indirectly reduces the valuation of investment to a Liquidity Pool by a Liquidity Provider.\n"

          "details": "* How traders are making profits using AMM?\n  - Arbitrage:\n    * It is an investment strategy in which an investor (a.k.a. Arbitrageurs) simultaneously buys and sells the same asset in different markets(either AMM or some other market) to profit from tiny differences in the asset's listed price.\n  - Flash Swaps or Capital Free Arbitrage (used in Uniswap):\n    * It allows us to withdraw up to the full reserves of any ERC20 token on Uniswap and execute arbitrary logic at no upfront cost, provided that by the end of the transaction you either:\n      * Pay for the withdrawn ERC20 tokens with the corresponding pair tokens\n      * Return the withdrawn ERC20 tokens along with a small fee\n* One thing that causes the most loss to traders:-\n  - Slippage:\n    * The featured price of a cryptocurrency on a marketplace is the most recent price at which that cryptocurrency was bought by the buyer or sold by the seller. So in some cases where there are not enough counter-parties to trade with, then the market is said to be illiquid or prone to slippage.\n    * It occurs when the processing of large order volumes drives the prices of an asset up or down to mitigate this occurrence and this fluctuation of price is called volatility.\n    * In other words, Slippage is the difference between the expected price of an order and the price when the order executes. ( due to the volatility of cryptocurrency prices )\n    * For solving this illiquidity or slippage problem of the market we need liquidity which is provided by Liquidity Providers (or Market Makers) to make Liquidity Pools liquid again and this whole process is called Market Making.\n      \n"

They invented this technique for efficient time-stamping of digital documents.\n  * Adam Back in 2002 invents the idea of Proof of Work idea.\n  * Proof of Work was based on the paper work by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor (1992) that was aimed at eliminating junk mail.\n  * The sender needs to do some computational task before sending the mail. This was easy to do when done once but becomes infeasible to do for millions of recipients.\n  * Moreover, Blockchain is not Bitcoin rather Bitcoin employs the technology of Blockchain.  \n"

          "details": "- Blockchain ledger\n  * The ledger which is present in blockchain is more than a simple ledger. This ledger is quickly and easily accessbile by anyone and further shared by many which explains its distributive nature.\n  * These ledgers are responsible for process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.\n  * These are responsible for storing data and assets such as tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).\n  * Blockchain ledger is distributed. All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions.\n  * Due to this distributed mechanism the transactions are recorded only for once, eliminating the duplication of data something which is very frequent in traditional business mechanisms.\n  * Tampering or changing these transactions in the ledger is impossible for a particiapnt to do so.\n  * Thus, these records ensure proper immutability.\n\n- Blockchain Transactions and Blocks\n  * Whenever a transaction occurs it is stored as a \"block\" of data.\n  * These transactions show the movement of assets tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual).\n  * These data blocks store a variety of information such as who, what, when, where and also conditions such as temperature.\n  * Each block is connected to one before and after it. The blocks represent the flow of ownership of some data.\n  * Each of these blocks have a hashed reference to the block before it so you can trace every transaction all the way back to genesis block.\n  * These block are securely linked to each other to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.\n  * Blockchain hashes are highly secure. They strengthen the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain.\n"

Thus hashing creates great deal of security. \n\n- The Bad Effects\n  * Attackers who have fast hardware can easily \"crack\" hash values to original text.\n  * Good hash alogrithms are made to be collission resistant. But it is impossible to eliminate collissions completely. Algorithms like MD5 , SHA-1 are known to contain collsions-produce same hash value for two different input credentials.\n  * Rainbow tables are “optimized lookup tables” that can be used to reverse-engineer one-way hash functions. A rainbow table is basically a pre-computed set of plaintext strings and their corresponding hashes.\n  *  Large rainbow tables are publicly available, and attackers can use one of these tables to retrieve cleartext data that has been hashed.\n"

They invented this technique for efficient time-stamping of digital documents.\n  * Adam Back in 2002 invents the idea of Proof of Work idea.\n  * Proof of Work was based on the paper work by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor (1992) that was aimed at eliminating junk mail.\n  * The sender needs to do some computational task before sending the mail. This was easy to do when done once but becomes infeasible to do for millions of recipients.\n  * Moreover, Blockchain is not Bitcoin rather Bitcoin employs the technology of Blockchain.  \n"

This ledger is quickly and easily accessbile by anyone and further shared by many which explains its distributive nature.\n  * These ledgers are responsible for process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.\n  * These are responsible for storing data and assets such as tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).\n  * Blockchain ledger is distributed. All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions.\n  * Due to this distributed mechanism the transactions are recorded only for once, eliminating the duplication of data something which is very frequent in traditional business mechanisms.\n  * Tampering or changing these transactions in the ledger is impossible for a particiapnt to do so.\n  * Thus, these records ensure proper immutability.\n\n- Blockchain Transactions and Blocks\n  * Whenever a transaction occurs it is stored as a \"block\" of data.\n  * These transactions show the movement of assets tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual).\n  * These data blocks store a variety of information such as who, what, when, where and also conditions such as temperature.\n  * Each block is connected to one before and after it. The blocks represent the flow of ownership of some data.\n  * Each of these blocks have a hashed reference to the block before it so you can trace every transaction all the way back to genesis block.\n  * These block are securely linked to each other to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.\n  * Blockchain hashes are highly secure. They strengthen the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain.\n"

But it is impossible to eliminate collissions completely. Algorithms like MD5 , SHA-1 are known to contain collsions-produce same hash value for two different input credentials.\n  * Rainbow tables are “optimized lookup tables” that can be used to reverse-engineer one-way hash functions. A rainbow table is basically a pre-computed set of plaintext strings and their corresponding hashes.\n  *  Large rainbow tables are publicly available, and attackers can use one of these tables to retrieve cleartext data that has been hashed.\n"

They invented this technique for efficient time-stamping of digital documents.\n  * Adam Back in 2002 invents the idea of Proof of Work idea.\n  * Proof of Work was based on the paper work by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor (1992) that was aimed at eliminating junk mail.\n  * The sender needs to do some computational task before sending the mail. This was easy to do when done once but becomes infeasible to do for millions of recipients.\n  * Moreover, Blockchain is not Bitcoin rather Bitcoin employs the technology of Blockchain.  \n"

          "details": "- Blockchain ledger\n  * The ledger which is present in blockchain is more than a simple ledger. This ledger is quickly and easily accessbile by anyone and further shared by many which explains its distributive nature.\n  * These ledgers are responsible for process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.\n  * These are responsible for storing data and assets such as tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).\n  * Blockchain ledger is distributed. All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions.\n  * Due to this distributed mechanism the transactions are recorded only for once, eliminating the duplication of data something which is very frequent in traditional business mechanisms.\n  * Tampering or changing these transactions in the ledger is impossible for a particiapnt to do so.\n  * Thus, these records ensure proper immutability.\n\n- Blockchain Transactions and Blocks\n  * Whenever a transaction occurs it is stored as a \"block\" of data.\n  * These transactions show the movement of assets tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual).\n  * These data blocks store a variety of information such as who, what, when, where and also conditions such as temperature.\n  * Each block is connected to one before and after it. The blocks represent the flow of ownership of some data.\n  * Each of these blocks have a hashed reference to the block before it so you can trace every transaction all the way back to genesis block.\n  * These block are securely linked to each other to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.\n  * Blockchain hashes are highly secure. They strengthen the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain.\n"

Thus hashing creates great deal of security. \n\n- The Bad Effects\n  * Attackers who have fast hardware can easily \"crack\" hash values to original text.\n  * Good hash alogrithms are made to be collission resistant. But it is impossible to eliminate collissions completely. Algorithms like MD5 , SHA-1 are known to contain collsions-produce same hash value for two different input credentials.\n  * Rainbow tables are “optimized lookup tables” that can be used to reverse-engineer one-way hash functions. A rainbow table is basically a pre-computed set of plaintext strings and their corresponding hashes.\n  *  Large rainbow tables are publicly available, and attackers can use one of these tables to retrieve cleartext data that has been hashed.\n"

They invented this technique for efficient time-stamping of digital documents.\n  * Adam Back in 2002 invents the idea of Proof of Work idea.\n  * Proof of Work was based on the paper work by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor (1992) that was aimed at eliminating junk mail.\n  * The sender needs to do some computational task before sending the mail. This was easy to do when done once but becomes infeasible to do for millions of recipients.\n  * Moreover, Blockchain is not Bitcoin rather Bitcoin employs the technology of Blockchain.  \n"

This ledger is quickly and easily accessbile by anyone and further shared by many which explains its distributive nature.\n  * These ledgers are responsible for process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.\n  * These are responsible for storing data and assets such as tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).\n  * Blockchain ledger is distributed. All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions.\n  * Due to this distributed mechanism the transactions are recorded only for once, eliminating the duplication of data something which is very frequent in traditional business mechanisms.\n  * Tampering or changing these transactions in the ledger is impossible for a particiapnt to do so.\n  * Thus, these records ensure proper immutability.\n\n- Blockchain Transactions and Blocks\n  * Whenever a transaction occurs it is stored as a \"block\" of data.\n  * These transactions show the movement of assets tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual).\n  * These data blocks store a variety of information such as who, what, when, where and also conditions such as temperature.\n  * Each block is connected to one before and after it. The blocks represent the flow of ownership of some data.\n  * Each of these blocks have a hashed reference to the block before it so you can trace every transaction all the way back to genesis block.\n  * These block are securely linked to each other to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.\n  * Blockchain hashes are highly secure. They strengthen the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain.\n"

          "details": "- Non Reversibility - One way functions\n  * A good hash makes it impossible to crack the original password from the output or hash.\n\n- Diffusion or Avalanche Effect\n  * If there is a change in one bit of the original password then it should result change in half of the bits of its hash.\n  * This means even the smallest change in the original text brings about significant and unpredictable changes.\n\n- Deterministic \n  * A given password must generate the same hash value or enciphered text whenever the same input is being passed to it.\n\n- Collision Resistance\n  * When two different inputs give the same hash value it is known as collision.\n  * It should be hard to find two different passwords that hash to the same enciphered text. \n  * A good hash is considered to have a lot of zeros as the starting of the hash.\n\n- Non-predictable\n  * It should not be obvious enough to derive original text from the hash value. \n  * Hence the original text must be unpredictable. \n"

          "details": "- The Good Effects\n  * Cryptographic hashes take in clear and simple text passwords and convert them into enciphered text for storage.\n  * It becomes difficult for Attackers to decipher original text from the hash value if they wish to exploit that information. Thus hashing creates great deal of security. \n\n- The Bad Effects\n  * Attackers who have fast hardware can easily \"crack\" hash values to original text.\n  * Good hash alogrithms are made to be collission resistant. But it is impossible to eliminate collissions completely. Algorithms like MD5 , SHA-1 are known to contain collsions-produce same hash value for two different input credentials.\n  * Rainbow tables are “optimized lookup tables” that can be used to reverse-engineer one-way hash functions. A rainbow table is basically a pre-computed set of plaintext strings and their corresponding hashes.\n  *  Large rainbow tables are publicly available, and attackers can use one of these tables to retrieve cleartext data that has been hashed.\n"
