This puts a negative impact on growth.\n\n- Inefficiency\n  * Banks charge 3% for a credit card swipe\n  * 5-7% is charged for a wire transfer\n  * It takes 2 days to settle a stock transaction\n  * Fund transfer is slow\n  * Banks are prone to frauds, chargebanks and lack security as well.\n  * Banks do not allow micro-transitions.\n  * It is difficult to get paid using banks.\n\n- Lack of Interoperability\n  * Institutions are isolated from each other and have no interlinking.\n  * It is difficult to move funds from one bank to another.\n  * Difficult to move money from a bank to non bank.\n  \n- Opacity\n  * Banking institutions have very little transparency.\n  * Bank customers do not know the health of the bank.\n  * Individuals are forced to rely on costly regulation and promise of bailouts.\n\n- High operating cost\n  * Banking institutions have high running cost due to accomodate large number of workers.\n\nThese problems when not tackled lead to following destructive effects.\n\n- Missed Growth Opportunities\n  * Entrepreneurs who have suppose 25% ROI on their great idea, but their project is not executed due to high cost of credit card borrowing.\n  * High ROI project fuels high CAPEX, strong real GDP growth, and robust employment growth.\n\n- Inequality of opportunities\n  * Projects should be financed based on the quality of the idea and the soundness of the execution plan.\n  * Many have no access to internet commerce (to buy or sell).\n  * Given the number of unbanked and underbanked, this creates unequal opportunities and perpetuates or even exacerbates inequality.\n"

          "details": "Centralised Finance opens up a wide range of advancement in the current centralised system.\n\n- Transfer of Money \n  * Using DeFi sending money would be as easy as sending an email.\n  * You just need to enter other persons account address and your payment will directly go into their account.\n\n- Stream money around the globe\n  * One can stream money over ethereum\n  * This lets you pay someone their salary by the second, giving them access to their money whenever they need it. Or rent something by the second like a storage locker or electric scooter.\n\n- Access to stablecoins\n  * Volatility in the cryptocurrency is of huge concern which hinders its growth as well.\n  * DeFi community has introduced stablecoins.\n  * Their value remains peggged to another asset, usually a popular currency like dollar.\n  * Coins like Dai or USDC have a value that stays within a few cents of a dollar.\n\n- Borrowing \n  * DeFi helps in borrowing money with privacy. \n  * The borrower must put up collateral that the lender will automatically receive if their loan is not repaid. \n  * This allows you to borrow money without credit checks or handing over private information.\n\n- Flash loans\n  * DeFi introduced the concept of flash loans where the borrower gets loans without handling any collateral to lender.\n  * If the borrower is not able to pay the loan, the transaction is reversed as if it never occured.\n\n- Tokenization\n  * DeFi introduces the concepts of crypto tokens.\n  * Ethereum enables robust smart contract capabilities, thereby opening up the roads for issuing crypto tokens. \n  * Crypto tokens basically worked as digital assets present on a blockchain alongside having different features and uses.\n  \n- Constant Updation \n  * Developers can build upon existing code because DeFi is open source.\n  * Easy to build applications/products (Cloud simplified creation of applications. Blockchain simplifies creation of financial apps)\n  * This helps in removing bugs and bring about great innovations in the existing system. \n"

They invented this technique for efficient time-stamping of digital documents.\n  * Adam Back in 2002 invents the idea of Proof of Work idea.\n  * Proof of Work was based on the paper work by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor (1992) that was aimed at eliminating junk mail.\n  * The sender needs to do some computational task before sending the mail. This was easy to do when done once but becomes infeasible to do for millions of recipients.\n  * Moreover, Blockchain is not Bitcoin rather Bitcoin employs the technology of Blockchain.  \n"

This ledger is quickly and easily accessbile by anyone and further shared by many which explains its distributive nature.\n  * These ledgers are responsible for process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.\n  * These are responsible for storing data and assets such as tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).\n  * Blockchain ledger is distributed. All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions.\n  * Due to this distributed mechanism the transactions are recorded only for once, eliminating the duplication of data something which is very frequent in traditional business mechanisms.\n  * Tampering or changing these transactions in the ledger is impossible for a particiapnt to do so.\n  * Thus, these records ensure proper immutability.\n\n- Blockchain Transactions and Blocks\n  * Whenever a transaction occurs it is stored as a \"block\" of data.\n  * These transactions show the movement of assets tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual).\n  * These data blocks store a variety of information such as who, what, when, where and also conditions such as temperature.\n  * Each block is connected to one before and after it. The blocks represent the flow of ownership of some data.\n  * Each of these blocks have a hashed reference to the block before it so you can trace every transaction all the way back to genesis block.\n  * These block are securely linked to each other to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.\n  * Blockchain hashes are highly secure. They strengthen the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain.\n"

But it is impossible to eliminate collissions completely. Algorithms like MD5 , SHA-1 are known to contain collsions-produce same hash value for two different input credentials.\n  * Rainbow tables are “optimized lookup tables” that can be used to reverse-engineer one-way hash functions. A rainbow table is basically a pre-computed set of plaintext strings and their corresponding hashes.\n  *  Large rainbow tables are publicly available, and attackers can use one of these tables to retrieve cleartext data that has been hashed.\n"

          "details": "- How Ethereum Transaction work?\n  * Transactions involve sending data and/or ETH (or other tokens)\n  from one address to another.\n  * An Ethereum user can control addresses through an externally\n  owned account (EOA) or by using smart contract code (contract\n  account).\n  * An EOA is controlled using a private key. It has no code incorporated within and it enables user to send transactions.\n  * When sending data to a contract account, the data are used to\n  execute code in that contract.\n  * Transactions sent to an externally owned account (EOA) can only transfer ETH.\n  * A single transaction starts with an end user from an EOA, but it can pass through many dApps (decentralised Applications) before completing.\n  * Transaction begins with a single smart contract and continues to carry on all the intermediate steps within the contract body.\n\n- Blockchain Transactions and Blocks\n  * Whenever a transaction occurs it is stored as a \"block\" of data.\n  * These transactions show the movement of assets tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual).\n  * These data blocks store a variety of information such as who, what, when, where and also conditions such as temperature.\n  * Each block is connected to one before and after it. The blocks represent the flow of ownership of some data.\n  * Each of these blocks have a hashed reference to the block before it so you can trace every transaction all the way back to genesis block.\n  * These block are securely linked to each other to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.\n  * Blockchain hashes are highly secure. They strengthen the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain.\n\n- Atomicity\n  * This is one of the most important property of Ethereum Transaction Mechanism which makes DeFi different from CeFi.\n  * The transactions in Ethereum are atomic which means the clauses in a smart contract can lead to failure of transaction and thus all the steps of the transaction are reversed.\n  * Atomicity enables inter-contract and inter-blockchain function calls that are synchronous and atomic by nature. This idea spans over the clauses in a smart contract, failure in any of them results in discarding of the whole transaction.\n  * Atomicity is a critical feature of transactions because funds can move between many contracts (i.e., “exchange hands”) with the knowledge and security that if one of the conditions is not met, the contract terms reset as if the money never left the starting point.\n"

          "details": "- Mempool\n  * Transactions are posted to a memory pool, or mempool, before\n  they are added to a block. \n  * Miners monitor these posted transactions, add them to their own\n  mempool, and share the transaction with other miners to be\n  included in the next available block.\n\n- Miner Extractable Value\n  * Any actor can see transactions in the mempool by running or communicating with mining nodes.\n  * This observation allows for front-running (legal in the DeFi space) to miners. If miner encounters a large order, they can plan their order before that, hence the miners are incentivised to do so.\n  * Miner extractable value (MEV) is a measure of the profit that the miner could make by including, excluding or re-ordering transactions. \n  * This is one of the drawback of the Proof of work consensus mechanism. Obfuscating transactions can mitigate MEV, thus hiding from miners how they might profit from transactions.\n"

          "details": "- Smart Contracts\n  * Ethereum is the example of most popular smart contract platform.\n  * A smart contract is code that can create and transform arbitrary data or\n  tokens on top of the blockchain of which it is a part.\n  * These are extremely powerful because it allows users to trustlessly encode\n  rules for any type of transaction and even create scarce assets with specialized functionality.\n  * Many standard business contracts can be algorithmically encoded and algorithmically enforced. These contracts run on the Ethereum blockchain and are run on every node.\n  * This is not just useful for finance. For example, supply chains are another good example.\n\n- Gas \n  * Gas is a unit that measures the amount of computational effort that it will take to execute certain operations.\n  * Transactions have a gas fee that is the fee received by the miners for conducting transactions.\n  * Transactions have a gas fee, which varies based on the complexity\n  of the transaction. E.g., low gas fee is used to compensate a miner\n  for including and executing a transaction, and high gas fee for\n  more data-intensive transactions.\n  * There are two types of contract interactions : real transactions and local static calls (view or readonly operartion). For example, transfer of money is a real transaction whereas checking account balance is readonly operation.Real transactions always cost gas, local static calls do not cost gas. This occurs majorly because the transactions bring about a change in the whole ethereum blockchain whereas the read only functions are issued to the local node. The local node does the computation with its own resources and its copy of the blockchain.\n  * If a transaction reverts due to any failure or runs out of gas the\n  miner forfeits all gas used until that point. This helps miners earn even if large volumes of failed transactions occur.\n\n  - Gas fees\n    * The gas price is determined by the market and effectively creates\n    an auction for inclusion in the next Ethereum block.\n    * Higher gas fees signal higher demand and therefore generally\n    receive higher priority for inclusion.\n  \n  - Gas Price \n    * Every operation on the Ethereum blockchain requires gas.\n    * Each unit of gas has a gas price, which is denoted in gwei. 1 gwei = 1\n      billionth of an ETH. Gas prices increase as users outbid one another\n      during times of higher network congestion.\n  \n  - Gas Limit\n    * The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas a user is willing to use for a\n    transaction. A transaction can include multiple operations.\n    * If there is residual amount of gas after the transaction is complete, then the user gets back the remaining gas.\n  \n  - Mining\n    * Ethereum currently uses the proof of work consensus mechanism.\n    * Ethereum miners - computers running software - using their time and computation power to process transactions and produce blocks.\n    * Gas fees are used to compensate Ethereum miners for their work in verifying transactions and securing the network.\n\n  - Turing Complete\n    * Gas plays a very important role. If a malicious attack is planned then it would be extremely expensive to carry out.\n    * Ethereum is turing complete whereas Bitcoin is not.\n\n- Oracles\n  * Ethereum blockchain nows only of what happens inside the Blockchain. But how does it get the information needed from the outside world? Here Oracles come into play.\n  * An oracle, in the context of smart contract platforms, is any data source for reporting information external to the blockchain. \n\n  - Oracle Problem\n    * This refers to the correctness of the off-chain information that is provided by the oracle.\n    * One Ethereum-based platform known as Chainlink is designed to solve the\n    oracle problem by using an aggregation of data sources. The Chainlink\n    whitepaper includes a reputation-based system that is decentralized.\n\n  \n"

Instead of asset ownership,\n    governance token ownership applies to voting rights.\n    * Any platform with admin-controlled functionality is not truly DeFi\n    because of the admins’ centralized control. For this reason, many platforms strive for a decentralized upgrade process, often mediated by a governance token.\n    * UNI token introduced by Uniswap DEX, is a type of governance token which used, as voting rights whenever there is a need to incorporate an upgrade in the existing mechanism of exchange.\n\n- ERC-721 (Ethereum Request for Comment 721)\n  * ERC-721 defines the non-fungible standard. It is similar to ERC-20 except that each unit has its own unique ID.\n  * NFTs act as a  representation for unique ownership of unitary assets.\n  * NFTs can be used to represent collectibles (eg. onwership of a piece of art).\n\n- ERC 1155\n  * ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens require an individual contract and address deployed to the blockchain.\n  * Due to different requirements of fungible and non fungible tokens it can be cumbersome for system.\n  * ERC-1155 resolves this complexity by defining a multi-token model in which the contract holds balances for a variable number of tokens, which can be fungible or nonfungible.\n\n  \n"

          "details": "Traditional finance models and tools have worked well until the last few years, but they leave a lot to be desired when it comes to offering compensation for new ways of collaboration or providing access to a global financial system for everyone. Let's take a look at some of the areas where traditional finance falls short:\n\n### Compensation\nWith the traditional ways of compensating employees through salaries or stocks, many organizations are now finding it difficult to keep up with the changing demands of the workforce. With more people working remotely and for fewer hours each week, the rigid financial structures of traditional companies are no longer able to keep up. However, in the world of cryptocurrency, one can simply write a few lines of code to create and distribute tokens based on whatever rules they want. This flexibility has already led to some incredible changes in the way we compensate team members. Compensation by traditional finance fails in the following scenarios\n1) **Global Projects/Companies** - With the rise of globalization, we now have teams of individuals who work together across timezones and may never meet or talk to one another in person. In many cases, these types of remote communities or projects are the most effective ones. For these projects, local compensation rules are outdated and they want new and flexible ways of compensating the project members.\n2) **Open Source Projects** - Open source projects can reach a great level of success, but the people who put work into them often don't reap any benefits when the project does well. The reason is that it's tricky to come up with a standard business model for open source projects. If you're thinking of contributing to an open source project, it's crucial to think about how you can monetize it. Financially stable projects can allow team members to work on things they're passionate about full time with like-minded people - which sounds amazing, right?\n3) **Flexible Roles and Responsibilities** - With organizations' outcomes in terms of revenue and profits becoming more unpredictable than ever, it's important that compensation models and software can adapt to assign equity to all contributors in a flexible way based on the work they actually perform. This allows for a more accurate division of rewards and motivates people to continue putting in their best effort even when things are tough.\n\n### Global Financial System\nDeveloped countries offer residents more reliable financial opportunities than many other parts of the world. For example, people in developing countries may not have access to reliable investing tools that can protect their money from things like hyper inflation. Traditional Finance doesn't provide the following investment tools to everyone globally\n1) **Stock Investing** - When it comes to investing, some of the most stable companies to put your money into are ones like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Tesla. Even with Tesla's stock prices rising by over 10,000%, many people have held onto their shares - but not everyone has that opportunity. There are plenty of people globally who don't have access to these modern growth stocks.\n2) **Vesture Investing** - Venture investing opportunities have been mostly limited to people with a net worth of a million dollars or earning upwards of $200,000 per year. Traditional investing offers no opportunity for small retail investors to get in on the action. Public companies have mostly gone through their exponential growth lifecycle, so retail investors get access to opportunities that have normalized growth.\n3) **Commodity investing** - investing in commodities like gold, silver, and copper - should be available to everyone. However, many countries lack the financial infrastructure needed for citizens to invest in these commodities. In addition, inflation rates in some countries can be as high as 200%, which reduces the purchasing power of citizens by half each year.\n\n### Business to Business Partnerships\nB2B partnerships can be very complex, involving legal contracts that can take months to finalize. Even the simplest contract can cost a business upwards of $10,000. This can make it very difficult for small businesses to collaborate and work towards common goals.\n\nIn the crypto world, however, you often see projects arranging token swaps. This creates a common financial interest for both parties, making it much easier to work together.\n\n### Lack of Liquidity\nLack of liquidity is a significant challenge for retail investors when it comes to investing in items such as real estate or small businesses. However, tokenization helps to overcome this by fractionalizing ownership and providing innovative ways to create liquidity. Some participants of the industry estimate that tokenization could lead to unlocking trillions of euros that are currently in illiquid assets, which would vastly increase the volumes of trade.",

          "details": "A Token can be thought of as a representation of value that can be exchanged or traded in most cases.\n\nThere are many different types of tokens:\n1) **Coins/AltCoins** - These are native to blockchain and can be used for payments or to power transactions. The most \n   famous type of coins are Bitcoin(BTC) and Ethereum(ETH). These are normally awarded to the validators of the \n   transaction, but can also be bought and exchanged.\n2) **Security tokens** -  are digital assets that represent some type of underlying asset, equity, or commodity. There are many different types of security tokens, including:\n\n   1) **Stocks or Bonds** - These tokens represent an underlying stock or bond. They help investors from any country gain exposure to one of the most famous stocks or bonds.\n\n   2) **Commodities** - These tokens represent a commodity, such as gold or oil. They help investors from any country gain exposure to the commodity market.\n\n   3) **Real Estate** - These tokens represent a piece of property. They help investors from any country gain exposure to the real estate market.\n3) **Protocol/product tokens** - these tokens are issued by a protocol and may or may not have any utility or governance power related to them. Examples of these tokens include MKR, AAVE and COMP. \n4) **Utility Tokens** - they can serve any purpose that a developer wants them to. In general, utility tokens provide access to a specific service or product within a blockchain ecosystem. They can often be the same as the protocol token or can be different. \n5) **Governance Tokens** - Governance tokens are primarily used for voting and decision-making within a protocol or organization. They may also offer some financial incentives, but their main purpose is to give token holders a say in how the protocol or organization is run.\n6) **Cause-Based Tokens** - they are designed to support a specific cause or charity. They typically don't offer any financial incentives or utility, but are meant to show support for the cause they represent. \n7) **NFTs** - NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a type of cryptocurrency that is limited in supply and has a unique identity. NFTs are difficult to copy or replicate, making them ideal for representing digital or real-world assets such as paintings, photographs, or other materials.\n\nFor asset or equity-backed tokens, there is usually a custodian and an investment institution involved in the process of creating a tokenized stock, assets or commodities. The institution buys the underlying stock and deposits it with the custodian. Based on the number of shares that the custodian holds in reserve, tokens are issued on a blockchain. The price of each token is pegged to the value of the shares.This process allows for a more efficient way of buying and selling stocks or assets, as well as a more secure way of storing them. By using a blockchain, there is no need for a third party to keep track of ownership or transactions. This makes the process more transparent and less susceptible to fraud.\n\nIn 2022, many cryptocurrency exchanges went bankrupt because the tokens they were holding were not kept isolated. These exchanges were centralized entities that were built on top of decentralized technology, and they didn't disclose whether or not users' funds were backed 1:1 at all times. As an educated blockchain user, we should be aware whenever we are depositing custody of our assets or tokens to anyone else.",

          "shortTitle": "Benefits",
          "details": "Some benefits of tokenization include:\n\n### Innovation for Today's Needs\n1) **Compensation** - Tokens offer a more flexible way of compensating team members than was previously available. For example, you can compensate team members in tokens based on the amount of their contribution and the criticality of their work. This allows the project to focus on developing the business rather than on fundraising. Also, everyone who receives tokens is now a shareholder and is aligned with the same goals.\n\n2) **Rewards** - Tokenization provides a more innovative way to compensate members or users who believe in a project's long-term success by distribute tokens based on bonding curves. This system would favour early adopters. Another example of this could be seen with Vote Escrowed Tokenomics where members who have locked their tokens away can earn boosted rewards because they believe in the project's longevity.\n\n3) **User Acquisition** - Startups typically spend a lot of money on marketing to acquire new customers through big advertizing companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, etc. However, this doesn't provide much help to the founders or to the end users. A better form of customer acquisition is through air drops. Air drops are one of the most innovative ways of acquiring new users as they reward the end user and also reduce the cost and the risk to the startup, as they are paying the acquired users in the form of tokens. This method is more beneficial to everyone involved - the founders, the end users, and even the startup itself!\n\n### More power to Retail Investor\n1) **More Opportunities for Investors** - Fractional ownership of assets provides many benefits to investors, including the ability to hold claims that are smaller than what is typically seen in stocks and bonds. This type of ownership also allows for the tokenization of assets, which can help investors gain access to asset classes and risks that they may not have otherwise had the ability to invest in.\n\n2) **Increased Liquidity** - The tokenization of assets can provide increased liquidity for otherwise illiquid assets. This can in turn help finance small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the real economy. This can make markets more efficient and help diversify investor risks.\n\n### Improved Financial System \n1) **Increased Speed and Lower Cost** - With automation in the issuance, distribution, and management of securities, as well as securities servicing and corporate actions, the entire securities transaction process becomes more efficient and cost-effective for both issuers and investors. Additionally, the distributed nature of the network with no single point of failure, the immutability of the ledger, and the application of cryptography make the infrastructure more resilient and safe.\n2) **Transparency**  - Transparency is one of the key benefits that blockchain technology can bring to the financial markets. By enhancing information recording and sharing, blockchain can help create a more transparent market environment, with data that is more accurate and reliable. This in turn can help boost investor confidence and make the markets more efficient. Additionally, the decentralized nature of blockchain can help reduce the risks of fraud and corruption, as well as improve auditability.\n3) **Better Regulation** - real-time information about on-chain events can help regulators better understand what's happening with specific projects. This, in turn, can lead to more informed decision-making when it comes to compliance and interactions with those behind the project.\n4) **Settlement and Clearing** - Settlement and clearing can be complex processes, especially in traditional financial markets. In these markets, central clearing houses act as central counterparties (CCPs) to both sides of a trade. This ensures that the trade is matched and executed even if one of the parties defaults, which reduces counterparty risk. Clearing houses confirm trade data and use central securities depositories (CSDs) to record transactions. Custodians holding investor assets work with CSDs to ensure the safe delivery/transfer of assets and funds to each of the respective transacting parties, and they handle the settlement of transactions. Blockchain technology can greatly improve efficiency in the settlement process by reducing complexity and shortening the settlement cycle to near real-time.",

          "details": "While tokenization has many potential benefits, including innovation, efficiency, security and enhanced liquidity, it also has some potential downsides.\n\n* **Complexity**: Tokenization can be a complex process, requiring technical expertise and specialized knowledge of blockchain technology. There is a steep learning curve on both the token issuer and the user side. The first step of getting started with  blockchain is setting up a wallet and getting some funds in, which in itself can be a very complex task for non technical users.\n\n* **Security risks**: Your tokens are always at risk of being lost if you forget your private key or if someone gets access to it. Since the cryptocurrency industry is not regulated, there are no checks by any government authority. In 2022, we saw many customers lose their funds as many exchanges were using customer's tokens for riskier bets without their consent.\n\n* **Regulation**: Tokenization is a new and unregulated area, which can create uncertainty and potential legal issues. Until the technology and tokens themselves are regulated, it cannot get investment from some of the biggest institutions like pension funds etc.\n\n* **High transaction fees**: Tokenization can be a great way for fractional ownership or getting liquidity, but it's important to be aware of the potential fees involved. When transacting on Bitcoin or Ethereum, for example, you may have to pay transaction fees. In contrast, many simple transactions made through centralized banks are free of charge. Additionally, banks often profit from hidden fees - which is not typically the case in decentralized finance.\n",

Yield farming originates from banks’ process in lending your deposits; the difference \n    is that DeFi yield farming compounds the interest earned.\n  * **Arbitrage** - Arbitrage takes advantage of the fact that an asset may be worth more in one market than another. While \n    this usually happens because of market inefficiencies, it can also be used to exploit differences in rates between \n    different platforms.\n  * **Margin Trading (Leverage)** - Taking out a loan with extra collateral can help you gain leverage, and you can repeat \n    the process until you reach the limit.\n  * **Liquidation** - Liquidations can be quite profitable, especially for tech-savvy traders. Usually, a liquidator has to \n    compete against other people for the same job, so he uses bots. They work by \"sniping\" the loans that are under the \n    collateralization ratio. This way, they can liquidate the collateral and reimburse the lender. In turn, the liquidator \n    receives a reward fee for his services.\n  * **Risk-reduction/Hedging** - No matter how well you think you know the markets, there will always be bumps in the road. As \n    a trader, you need to find ways to protect your investment from risk, and this is where crypto hedging strategies come in. \n    Hedging encompasses opening positions in opposing market directions to reduce the risks and impacts of market swings.

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, National \nStock Exchange(India), London Stock Exchange (LSE), and Tokyo Stock Exchange are among the more notable exchanges (TSE).\nExchanges can be subdivided: \n  - By objects sold or traded: Stock exchange, Crypto exchange, Commodities exchange, or Foreign exchange market. \n  - By type of trade: Classical exchange, Future & Options exchange.\n\nLet us dive into crypto exchanges.\n\n### What is a Crypto Exchange?\nCrypto or cryptocurrency or digital-currency exchange is a marketplace or platform which allows customers to trade \ncryptocurrencies for other assets, such as conventional fiat money(eg: U.S. Dollar, Japanese Yen, Euro, etc.) or \nother digital currencies.\n  \nIn addition to trading services, crypto exchanges provide price discovery through trading activity and crypto \nstorage.

Centralized \ncryptocurrency exchanges serve as a middleman between buyers and sellers and generate revenue through commissions and \ntransaction fees. You may think of a CEX as a stock exchange for digital assets.\n\nCoinbase, Crypto.com, Gemini, and Binance are well-known cryptocurrency exchanges. These exchanges let cryptocurrency \ninvestors buy and sell digital assets at the current price, known as spot, or leave orders that get executed when \nthe asset reaches the investor's preferred price objective, known as limit orders, in a manner similar to stock trading \nwebsites or applications.\n\nExchanges choose which digital assets to allow trading in, providing some reassurance that dishonest digital assets \nmay be barred. They also set exchange rules and fees as well as store customer data (such as KYC) and transactional data.\n\nSince one of the core principles of cryptocurrencies is that they are decentralized, or not issued or regulated by a \ngovernment or other central body, this may seem nonsensical. However, a centralized cryptocurrency exchange might \nmake it simpler to purchase the cryptocurrency you want using fiat money.\n\nSome centralized exchanges may be more susceptible to assault because they are held by a single party, which poses \na potential risk.\n\n### What is an Order Book?\nAn order book is a price-level-organized electronic list of purchase and sell orders for a given asset or financial \ninstrument. An order book records the number of shares bid or offered at each price point, often known as market depth. \nAs a result, the price of a digital asset will be determined by the supply and demand for that asset in comparison \nto another, whether it be a fiat currency or cryptocurrency.\n   \nAlmost every exchange uses order books to list orders for various assets such as equities, bonds, currencies, and \neven cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. These orders might be either manual or digital in nature.\n\n\n![Order Book](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-defi-course/blob/89865af46df4e3e877a8c216dd04b63c48ba23a2/images/1inch.png?raw=true)\n`Reference: https://medium.com/stabletrade/understanding-order-books-orders-b297ea51acff`\n\nThere are two types of CEX based on the order book model, there might be further ones but let's just discuss the two \nbasic components here:\n\n### Server Order Book model\nIn centralized exchanges which use the server order book model, all the customers' trading data, prices, and volumes \nof securities are stored in a Centralized Server. \nThe server order book model has its own advantages such as it supports faster trade matching and settlements which \nis great as speed is very important in financial settlements.\n\nThere are also a few drawbacks to this model.\nSince all data is stored on a centralized server and this centralized server is totally controlled by the exchange, \nthere is no censorship resistance. The exchange operators can front-run customers due to low transparency. \n\n### Onchain Order Book model\nIn an on-chain order book model, all the customers' trading data, prices, and volumes of securities are stored on a \nBlockchain. Thus, there is no central server is involved in this case which results in a high level of transparency. \nIt provides censorship resistance, as all data are stored on a distributed, and decentralized ledger in the form of \nimmutable data blocks on the blockchain which are publicly shared among all its network nodes. \n\nEven in this model, there is a slight risk of front-running the users by miner/trader/exchange operator.\n"

These \ndecentralized exchanges are powered by blockchain-based smart contracts, which are self-executing bits of code. \nCompared to a centralized exchange, these smart contracts provide better privacy and less slippage (another term \nfor transaction charges). However, even though smart contracts are based on regulations, the lack of a middleman leaves \nthe user on their own, making DEXs appropriate only for experienced investors.\n\nIn a way, they increase complexity for users as users must remember their crypto wallet keys and passwords, or \ntheir funds will be lost permanently and cannot be recovered. In contrast to centralized exchanges, which provide a \nmore convenient and user-friendly process, they require the user to understand and become acquainted with the platform \nand the process. Also, these exchanges are best suited for investors wishing to transition from one digital asset to \nanother, but not for those looking to purchase or sell digital assets with fiat currency, a process known as on and \noff-ramping. It makes them less appealing to users who do not already own cryptocurrency.\n\n- Pros of Decentralized Exchange\n  * No KYC is required as trades are done in terms of account address \n  * No fees are paid to the exchange.\n  * No impermanent loss (this will be discussed later in this course)\n  * Censorship resistance is governed by Smart Contracts and not by any central authority\n\n- Cons Decentralized Exchange\n  * Fees (i.e Gas Fee) are deducted as an additional charge for a deposit, withdrawal, or trade creation/cancelation.\n  * Trade settlement might be slow due to blockchain scalability issues. \n  * Sometimes, not fully decentralized due to mediating server for speeding the process of trade execution.\n"

For example, Uniswap uses the Constant Product AMM protocol which is as follows:\n\nAsset X quantity * Asset Y quantity = K (a constant)  simply  X*Y=K\n\nProperties of popular Constant Product AMM protocol:\n  * Instant liquidity, irrespective of the trade size (assuming that trade size is always less than pool size).\n  * Purchase of asset X increases the price of X and decreases the price of Y\n  * The ratio of assets X and Y sets the price\n![Automated Market Maker](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-defi-course/blob/89865af46df4e3e877a8c216dd04b63c48ba23a2/images/amm.png?raw=true)\n`Reference: https://berkeley-defi.github.io/assets/material/Updated%20Lecture%205%20Slides.pdf`\n\nNow, What is a Protocol?\nProtocols are basic sets of rules that allow data and cryptocurrencies to be shared securely between different nodes (i.e computers) in the blockchain network.\n\n- Pros of an AMM:\n  * No Order Book Maintenance for traders but arbitrage is required for them.\n  * A simple implementation of Constant Product AMM causes less computation which results in Low gas costs.\n\n- Cons of an AMM:\n  * The danger of Impermanent loss/Coin De-Pegg may cause a total possible loss of funds in Liquidity Pools.\n  * High slippage for low liquidity markets. So, please do observe and set your slippage tolerance threshold level while trading.\n"

          "details": "A Liquidity Pool is a collection of two asset pairs X and Y (Let’s say for example in the case of Constant Product AMM), \nfunded by Liquidity Providers(LP), that are locked in a smart contract, to facilitate trading, borrowing, lending, yielding, etc.\n\nIt ensures that buy and sell orders are carried out no matter the time of the day and at whatever price you want to \ntrade without looking for any direct counterparty(as in the case of Order Book) as AMM ensures this. Hence, we won’t \nneed to find a seller to buy a token. All that is needed is sufficient liquidity in the pool.\n\nWhen a token swap occurs, the AMM ensures that the price adjusts based on its algorithm. The algorithm ensures that \nthere is always liquidity in the pool, no matter the trade size. \n\nFor eg: A liquidity pool is, by default, a 50:50 ratio of 2 coins. Let's say 50% dai (DAI) and 50% ether (ETH). When \nyou buy DAI with ETH, the pools will start to lose DAI and get more ETH. The algorithm increases the price of Dai and \nlowers the price of ether to keep the ratio regulated. The process is a self-regulated automated reaction to the market's needs.\n\n![Liquidity Pool](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-defi-course/blob/89865af46df4e3e877a8c216dd04b63c48ba23a2/images/liquidity-pool.png?raw=true)\n`Reference: https://berkeley-defi.github.io/assets/material/Updated%20Lecture%205%20Slides.pdf`\n"

          "shortTitle": "Liquidity Providers",
          "key": "liquidity-providers",
          "details": "Types of rewards that Liquidity Providers get on funding Liquidity Pools are:\n\n### Trading Fees\nIncentive or reward in terms of trading fees that are paid by traders to the Liquidity Providers on each trade they undertake.\nThe way that this works is the trading fees value is directly added into the pool so as such the liquidity providers \nthey have an LP coin which represents the share of the allocation in this pool and because this pool is growing through \ntrading fees the share of the pool remains the same, relatively speaking. But the absolute value of the of the pool \nobviously grows and therefore the LP coins grow in value through the addition of trading fees. An example in Curve.fi \nis that the LPs they get 0.03 of the trading fees from the users. So in essence you if you're participating as a \nliquidity provider in a pool you are gaining interest on based on the user behavior so the more users trade the more financial value you will receive.\n\n### Liquidity Mining\nLiquidity mining can be seen as being equal to an incentive that's created for participants to participate in a particular \ndefi protocol. It is a reward given to the Liquidity Providers(LP) proportional to the amount of liquidity provided by them.\nIt can also be provided to the LPs in terms of “Airdrops”. Airdrops are tokens that are given to traders and LPs for \nfree or in exchange for minimal promotional work.\n\nThese are rewards that any DeFi protocol can manually specify so they can for example say if you provide a certain \namount of liquidity to a pool then the protocol (this is actually the the DeFi protocol i.e. instructors or developers) \nwill basically give some token as a reward. So this is a liquidity mining reward and this incentive exists in order \nto incentivize liquidity providers to deposit more and more assets into a pool, hence attracting more liquidity and \nthus attracting more traders because the slippage becomes lower because the trading volume grows and volume attracts \nvolume in the exchange businesses.\n\nNow, Let's discuss the types of losses for Liquidity Providers :\n\n### Impermanent loss\nImpermanent loss basically means Not Permanent Loss. Impermanent Loss arises when the price ratio of an asset and \nliquidity pool changes. So, Liquidity Providers (LPs) who have deposited funds in affected pools automatically incur \nthis loss. The larger the shift in the price ratio the larger the loss. However, this loss is called impermanent for \na reason. As long as we do not withdraw deposited tokens at a time that the pool is experiencing a shift in price \nratio it is still possible to mitigate the loss. \n\nThis loss disappears when the prices of the tokens revert to the original value at which they were deposited. Those \nwho withdraw funds before the prices revert suffer permanent losses. Nonetheless, it is possible to compensate the \nlosses through income received by liquidity providers via Trading fees (i.e fees taken from traders during each trading \ntransaction) and Liquidity mining reward (i.e reward given by the DEX in the form of its governance tokens or some \nother asset as interests).\n\nFinding a solution to impermanent loss is not simple but quite challenging. A potential solution is to change to bonding cuve (the curve that governs the amm liquidity).\n\nThe image below provides an example of impermanent loss.\n![Impermanent Loss](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-defi-course/blob/89865af46df4e3e877a8c216dd04b63c48ba23a2/images/impermanent-loss.png?raw=true)\n`Reference: https://berkeley-defi.github.io/assets/material/Updated%20Lecture%205%20Slides.pdf`\n\n### Coin de-peg:\nDe-pegging refers to the phenomenon of a stablecoin deviating or any asset deviating from its intended peg. For \nexample: In the case of a stablecoin pegged to USD, if its value reduces below $1, then the coin is said to be \n“de-pegged” which indirectly reduces the valuation of investment to a Liquidity Pool by a Liquidity Provider.\n"

          "details": "Now, Let us discuss how traders make profits using AMM?:-\n\n### Arbitrage\nArbitrage is an investment strategy in which an investor (a.k.a. Arbitrageurs) simultaneously buys and sells the same asset in different markets to profit from tiny differences in the asset's listed price. Arbitrage is the practice by which different prices on various exchanges or markets become synchronized. These markets could be either AMM or some other market.\nNaturally this requires to perform at least one transaction. So either you could only want to perform an arbitrage transaction on a single market but this is under the assumption that you already own some of the coins (Let’s say x and y) which you will swap and maybe you want to replenish your portfolio. But typically an arbitrage is done by having one transaction that either purchases an asset on one market and other sells the asset on another. These two actions are swap actions and they can be all done in a single transaction ideally. \n\nBelow is an pictorial example of arbitrage.\n![Arbitrage](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-defi-course/blob/89865af46df4e3e877a8c216dd04b63c48ba23a2/images/arbitrage.png?raw=true)\n`Reference: https://berkeley-defi.github.io/assets/material/Updated%20Lecture%205%20Slides.pdf`\n\n### Flash Swaps or Capital Free Arbitrage \nUsed in Uniswap, It allows us to withdraw up to the full reserves of any ERC20 token on Uniswap and execute arbitrary logic at no upfront cost, provided that by the end of the transaction you either:\n* Pay for the withdrawn ERC20 tokens with the corresponding pair tokens\n* Return the withdrawn ERC20 tokens along with a small fee\n\nOne thing that causes the most loss to traders:\n### Slippage\nThe featured price of a cryptocurrency on a marketplace is the most recent price at which that cryptocurrency was bought by the buyer or sold by the seller. So in some cases where there are not enough counter-parties to trade with, then the market is said to be illiquid or prone to slippage.\nIt occurs when the processing of large order volumes drives the prices of an asset up or down to mitigate this occurrence and this fluctuation of price is called volatility.\nIn other words, Slippage is the difference between the expected price of an order and the price when the order executes. ( due to the volatility of cryptocurrency prices )\nFor solving this illiquidity or slippage problem of the market we need liquidity which is provided by Liquidity Providers (or Market Makers) to make Liquidity Pools liquid again and this whole process is called Market Making.\n\n![Slippage](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-defi-course/blob/89865af46df4e3e877a8c216dd04b63c48ba23a2/images/slippage.png?raw=true)\n\n`Reference: https://berkeley-defi.github.io/assets/material/Updated%20Lecture%205%20Slides.pdf`\n      \n"

          "title": "DEX Aggregator",
          "shortTitle": "Aggregator",
          "key": "dex-aggregators",
          "details": "We have looked at decentralized exchanges in isolation, but now we're going to look at how to aggregate or merge them together.\nDEX Aggregators are financial protocols that enable cryptocurrency traders to access a range of trading pools from a single dashboard. Users really are interested in the deepest liquidity in order to pay the lowest slippage on their trades. So the exchange aggregators source liquidity from all the different exchanges and merge them so that the user only has to access a single dashboard to exchange their assets and then the exchange aggregator find the best liquidity, the lowest prices, lowest commissions etc as per user’s interest. \n\nThere are overall two types of aggregators that are currently prevalent they're so-called off-chain aggregators and on-chain aggregators. \n\n### Off-chain Aggregators\nOff-chain Aggregators like 1inch, paraswap are websites where you can go and you have your browser wallet or your crypto wallet activated perform trades. They are quite flexible, that means you can perform trades across multiple chains efficiently instead of just a single chain. They are also very quick in determining the optimal trade. The disadvantage of such aggregators is that operators can front run users because the operator is a trusted third person here which is in the middle between the exchange and the user. The off chain aggregation is typically performed off-chain as the name suggests so the computation of the trait with the optimal parameters is not performed on chain and can therefore not always be optimal.\n\nLet's discuss about 1inch. The UI of one inch is really beautifully verbose, you can see a lot of data, you can analyze which markets might be better, also choose to go directly to these websites right if you want to pay a less gas price for instance. So it's quite intuitive and flexible. For example to exchange Ether and DAI you input the amount that you would like to exchange so it will also show you a list of the various exchanges where you can perform this trade right. It actually explains you which route is taken for your swap. There might be more complicated routes that emerge depending on the swap that you're enacting. Your trade might also open up an arbitrage opportunity since you're you're swapping assets and you're changing liquidity on one exchange so there will be another market where there's an arbitrage opportunity created due to your swap.\n![1inch](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-defi-course/blob/89865af46df4e3e877a8c216dd04b63c48ba23a2/images/1inch.png?raw=true)\n\n`Reference: https://berkeley-defi.github.io/assets/material/Updated%20Lecture%205%20Slides.pdf`\n\n### On-chain Aggregators\nThen there are on-chain aggregators like swapswap is an example of this. They are much less famous at the moment than than off-chain aggregators but they do have some key advantages, for example, they allow you to perform atomic routing and arbitrage which is provably optimal on-chain. The smart contract basically does everything for the user and there is no middleman. There is basically a very small likelihood of being front run so it's technically a little bit safer however they don't scale as much as the off-chain variants so they're unlikely to efficiently cover many more exchanges in parallel like the off-chain aggregators.\n\nSwapSwap is a recent emerging on-chain aggregator which aggregates two DEXs so that's not much but it's a beginning so you have UniSwap and SushiSwap that's being aggregated. There's no particular UI change for the user so you have here a standard Uniswap UI. You do not really see at the moment like what financial advantages you get out of this aggregator but in theory you should get better prices than on Uniswap and Sushiswap since you're aggregating the liquidity together. The beautiful thing is that it basically routes a swap if the smart contract deems this to be profitable. So the smart contract will decide at execution time whether this should be now routed or not and it does perform arbitrage with flash loans so it does not leave money on the table. So if profitable it will create even a flash loan for you on the fly ,transparently, in the background and perform all this in the smart contract.\n![SwapSwap](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-defi-course/blob/89865af46df4e3e877a8c216dd04b63c48ba23a2/images/swapswap.png?raw=true)\n`Reference: https://berkeley-defi.github.io/assets/material/Updated%20Lecture%205%20Slides.pdf`\n\nSo next time you hit an exchange think about maybe visiting some aggregators, checking the prices there maybe they \nare cheaper maybe not and just try around a little bit too especially if you want to exchange larger amounts.\n"

Hence, we won’t need to find a seller to buy a token. All that is needed is sufficient liquidity in the pool.\n  * When a token swap occurs, the AMM ensures that the price adjusts based on its algorithm. The algorithm ensures that there is always liquidity in the pool, no matter the trade size. \n  * For eg., A liquidity pool is, by default, a 50:50 ratio of 2 coins. Let's say 50% dai (DAI) and 50% ether (ETH). When you buy DAI with ETH, the pools will start to lose DAI and get more ETH. The algorithm increases the price of dai and lowers the price of ether to keep the ratio regulated. The process is a self-regulated automated reaction to the market's needs.  \n"

So, Liquidity Providers (LPs) who have deposited funds in affected pools automatically incur this loss. The larger the shift in the price ratio the larger the loss.\n    * However, this loss is called impermanent for a reason as long as we do not withdraw deposited tokens at a time that the pool is experiencing a shift in price ratio it is still possible to mitigate the loss.\n    * This loss disappears when the prices of the tokens revert to the original value at which they were deposited.\n    * Those who withdraw funds before the prices revert suffer permanent losses.\n    - Nonetheless, it is possible to negate the losses through income received by liquidity providers via:\n      * Trading fees (i.e fees taken from traders during each trading transaction).\n      * Liquidity mining reward (i.e reward given by the DEX in the form of its governance tokens or some other asset as interests).\n  - Coin de-peg:\n    * De-pegging refers to the phenomenon of a stablecoin deviating or any asset deviating from its intended peg. For example: In the case of a stablecoin pegged to USD, if its value reduces below $1, then the coin is said to be “de-pegged” which indirectly reduces the valuation of investment to a Liquidity Pool by a Liquidity Provider.\n"

          "details": "### Introduction\n- Derivatives are one of the essential features of a mature financial system. As the name clearly suggests derivatives derive their value from something (asset). The price of the derivatives is the price of the underlying asset in the derivatives such as a stock, a bond, a commodity, an interest rate, a currency or a cryptocurrency.\n\n- Some of the most common forms of derivatives that are present in the current financial system are forwards, futures, options and swaps. There are two main uses of derivatives: Hedging and Speculation.\n\n### Hedging\n* Hedging allows the management of financial risks. To understand hedging consider an example of a farmer that \nprimarily focuses on growing wheat. The wheat price can fluctuate throughout the year depending on the current demand \nand supply. As the farmer plant wheat, they are committed to it for the entire growing season which possesses a big \nrisk in the case when the price of wheat is low when the harvest time comes. To accommodate this risk the farmer will \nsell short wheat futures contracts for the amount they predict to harvest. Gradually as the time of the harvest approaches \nthe farmer will close their position and incur a profit or loss based on the current price of the wheat. If the price of wheat is lower compared to the anticipated price then the short position makes a profit that offsets the loss from selling the actual wheat whereas if the current price is higher then the short position will be at a loss but profit from selling the wheat offsets the loss. Thus it concludes that whatever the price of wheat the farmer could easily predict their payout.\n\n* Yield farmers in the decentralised can also use hedging to offset a potential that can occur if the price of one \nof the tokens used for yield farming loses its value in relation to another token.\n\n### Speculations\n* In a lot of financial instruments including derivatives, speculation can represent a significant amount of traded volume. This is because derivatives offer an easy exposure to particular assets that may be hard to access otherwise, for example, trading oil futures rather than oil barrels.\n\n* Speculations can also provide easy access to leverage. A trader can purchase a call or a put option by providing only enough funds to cover the options premium and gain exposure to a significant amount of underlying assets. Speculators are important market participants as they provide liquidity to the market and allow people who actually need to buy a particular derivative to hedge the risk to easily enter and exit the market.\n\n* Derivatives have a prolonged interesting history. From using clay tokens and fur letters to buy and sell agricultural commodities in medieval Europe to the establishment of the Chicago Board of Trade in 1848 -one of the world's oldest futures and options exchanges.\n"

          "details": "Financial derivatives combine usually of 4 most important parameters - Futures, Options, Swaps and Forwards.\n\n- Forwards\n\n  * An agreement to buy or sell an asset at a given price on a specific date in the future is known as a forward contract, which is frequently abbreviated to just \"forward.\" In order to prevent price fluctuation, forward contracts can be utilised to lock in a set price. \n\n  * A forward contract's buyer and seller each take on a position, with the buyer taking a long position and the seller taking a short position. The long position gains if the value of the underlying asset rises. The short position gains from a decline in the price of the underlying asset.\n\n- Futures\n  * Futures are financial derivative contracts that bind parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified future time and price. Regardless of the market price at the date of expiration, the buyer or seller must buy or sell the underlying asset at the agreed-upon price. \n\n  * A forward contract is an individual, flexible contract that settles at its conclusion and is traded over the counter. The parameters of a futures contract are standardised, and it is traded on an exchange where prices are settled every day until the contract's expiration.\n\n- Options\n\n  * Options are a type of derivative financial transaction in which two parties contractually agree to exchange an asset for cash at a given price ahead of a future date. An option grants its owner the choice to buy or sell a security at the exercise price, but the owner is not required to do so.\n\n- Swaps\n\n  * Through a derivative contract known as a swap, two parties can exchange the liabilities or cash flows from two various financial instruments. An interest rate swap is the most typical type of exchange. In general, swaps are not traded on exchanges or used by regular investors. Instead, swaps are specialised over-the-counter (OTC) contracts that are made to meet the interests of both parties and are typically made between businesses or financial organisations.\n\nFutures and Options are two most important type of financial derivatives because they are traded on exchange.\n"

Regardless of the market price at the date of expiration, the buyer or seller must buy or sell the underlying asset at the agreed-upon price.\n\n\n- Physical commodities and financial instruments are examples of underlying assets. Futures contracts are standardised to make trading on a futures market easier and specify the quantity of the underlying asset. Futures can be utilised for trade speculation or hedging.\n\n\n- Futures or Futures contracts have an expiration date and their price is known beforehand. These contracts are identified by their expiration month. For example, November futures will expire in the month of November.\n\n- There are primarily 5 types of futures-\n\n  1. `Commodity Futures` which consist of crude oil, wheat, natural gas etc.\n  2. `Stock index future` with underlying assets such as the S&P 500 Index.\n  3. `Currency futures` which represent British Pound and Euro\n  4. `Precious Metals` such as gold or silver\n  5. `U.S. treasury futures` with underlying bond and financial securities\n\n- Trading of Futures Contract  \n  * Futures Contracts are a type of financial instrument through which a buyer can wager on the future price of a commodity or other security.\n\n  * Futures contracts are created and regulated by exchanges. These exchanges are responsible for the standardisation of various parameters in these contracts. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversees futures markets (CFTC). In order to protect the integrity of futures market pricing, including prohibiting fraudulent activity and abusive trading methods, the CFTC is a government organisation that was established by Congress in 1974.\n\n\n- Hedging through futures\n\n  * Futures can be used to hedge against price fluctuations in the underlying asset. In this instance, preventing losses from potentially negative price movements is the goal rather than engaging in speculation. Many businesses engage in hedging or, in certain situations, produce the underlying asset.\n\n\n- Speculation through futures\n\n  * A trader can make predictions (speculate) about the course of a commodity's price using a futures contract. The trader would profit if a futures contract and the commodity's price rose to trade above the contract's starting price at expiration. The futures contract—the long position—would be sold at the current price before expiration, so completing the long position.\n\n- Buyer and Seller \n\n  - `Long Contract`\n    * Investors and businesses can also enter into long futures contracts to protect themselves against unfavourable price changes. A corporation can use a long hedge to fix the price at which it will buy a commodity in the future when it is required. They are required to carry out these tasks but are not given a choice.\n\n\n    * Speculators buy futures when they anticipate price increases. They are just concerned with profiting from price fluctuations, therefore they don't necessarily need the actual commodity. A trader with a long futures contract may sell the contract in the market before it expires.\n\n\n    * `Prices rise`- The position holder is at a profit.\n    * `Prices fall`- The position holder is at a loss.\n\n  - `Short Contract`\n    * When a trader first sells security with the purpose of later repurchasing or covering it at a lower price, they are creating a short, or short position. When a trader anticipates that the price of a security will drop in the near future, she may elect to short that security.\n\n\n    * Only when the closing price is lower than the entry price is the short trade profitable. When the price rises above the price at which one has shorted, a loss would result. In a short trade, the stop loss is always set higher than the price at which the trade was initiated. In the futures market, the short position may be kept open overnight.\n\n\n    * `Prices rise`- The position holder is at a loss.\n    * `Prices fall`- The position holder is at a profit.  \n"

          "details": "A derivative, or contract, is an option that grants the buyer the right , but not the obligation, to purchase or sell the underlying asset by a particular date (expiration date) at a particular price (strike price). Options can be classified in two types which are Call and Put Options.\n\n\nOptions being as derivative are mostly used for hedging and speculations. It is very frequent that an investor who owns stocks buys or sells options on the exchange to hedge his investments in the underlying asset. Moreover options may be used as speculative investments.\n\n- Use Cases\n\n  - Hedging\n    * An investor can purchase put options on a stock if they anticipate that specific equities in heir portfolio will lose value but do not want to permanently exit the trade. Profits from the put options will offset losses from the shares itself if the price of the stock does decrease.\n\n  - Speculation\n    * An investor can buy calls or sell puts to profit from a gain in price if they anticipate the price of a security will increase. The investor's overall risk while purchasing call options is capped at the option premium. The amount of money they could make is theoretically limitless. It depends on how much the market price is higher than the option's strike price as well as the number of options the investor has.\n  \n  - Leverage\n    * Options are essentially leveraged instruments since they enable investors to increase the possible upside profit by investing less money than would otherwise be necessary to trade the underlying asset. Therefore, you could theoretically spend $2,000 on a call contract with a strike price 10% higher than the current market price instead of spending $10,000 to acquire 100 shares of a $100 stock.\n\n  - Benefit from downside\n    * In options market, a trader can benefit from the downside of the market by betting on “Put options” where the trader gets the right to sell (not obligation) the underlying asset.\n\n- Trading Options- Call Options\n  * Option contracts are prepared by option writer known as granter or seller. An option writer is the one who sells an option and receives premium from the buyer in exchange, by opening a position. Options are of two types - “calls” and “puts”. With a “call” option the buyer gets the right to buy the underlying asset whereas from the “put” option the buyer gets the right to sell the underlying asset at a pre-decided price and on or before a pre-decided date.\n\n  - `Buying Calls` \n    * You can purchase a “call” option with less capital than the underlying asset if you believe the price of an asset will increase. In contrast, your losses are capped to the premium paid for the options and nothing more if the price instead declines. This strategy is adopted by traders who are bullish and confident about a particular stock, Exchange Traded Fund and want to minimise their risks.\n\n\n    * A general equity option stock manages 100 shares of the underlying asset.\n\n  - `Risk/Reward Analysis`\n    * In the view of a long call or call buying the trader has his/her losses limited only to the premium paid to the call seller. Whereas considering the profits , which can be unlimited because the underlying asset can rise upto any extent.\n\n- Trading Options- Put Options\n\n  - `Buying Puts` \n    * A put option gives the buyer the right to sell an underlying asset at a set price. This strategy is adopted by a trader who is bearish in nature and want to take less risk compared to short-selling.\n\n  - `Risk/Reward Analysis`\n    * A long put's potential loss is capped at the premium for the options because the underlying price cannot go below zero, the position's potential profit is limited, but the put option amplifies the trader's return similarly to a long call option.\n\n\n- Buyer and seller\n\n  - `Call Seller`\n    * A call seller is a person who executes the selling of a call option. This seller gets the premium paid by the call buyer during the betting on the contract. Call Seller receives this premium which is a fraction of the total lot size of the contract known as the token amount. The view of a call seller towards the market is not bullish i.e. they predict that the market stay stagnant or go bearish which means falls down the current level. For a call seller the profits are limited to the premium amount they received whereas the losses they might suffer are unlimited if the market rises above the exercise price. Moreover, they are obligated to sell the derivative in case the call buyer is willing to execute the option.\n\n  - `Put Seller`\n    * A put seller is an individual who executes the buying of a put option. This seller , similar to previous , gets the premium by the put buyer during the betting of the contract. The view of a put seller towards the market is not bearish i.e. he/she wants that the market stays stagnant or go bullish which means rises above the current level. For a put seller the profits are limited to the premium amount they received from put buyer and the losses can maximise as the market prices soar above the exercise price. A put seller is obligated to buy when the put buyer wants to sell the derivative.\n\n  - `Call Buyer`\n    * A call buyer is a person who executes the buying of a call option. This buyer has to pay the premium during the buying of a call contract.The motive behind buying a call option is that the buyer is bullish in nature i.e. he/she predicts that the market will rise in the upcoming time and his portfolio will gain profits. For a call buyer the profits are unlimited if the market keeps on rising above the exercise price whereas the losses only include the premium amount he paid to the call seller. A call buyer has the right to execute the buying but he/she is not obligated to do so.\n\n  - `Put Buyer`\n    * A put buyer is the one who buys a put option to have the right to sell. This buyer pays a premium to the put seller during the buying of the contract. He/She buys a put option due to the bearish behaviour i.e. he/she predicts that the market wil fall in the upcoming times. For a put buyer the profits are unlimited because the rates may fall more than the exercise price but on the other hand the losses are limited to the premium he/she paid to the put seller for placing the contract. A put buyer has the right to sell the option but he/she is not obligated to do so.\n"

          "title": "Derivatives Protocols",
          "shortTitle": "Derivatives Org",
          "key": "protocols-in-derivatives",
          "details": "- The total market of the derivatives is considered to be as high as one quadrillion dollars which is far more when compared stock market, bond markets or the merging cryptocurrency market. Ever-growing market naturally develops its own derivatives market that can end up being an order of magnitude bigger than its underlying market. This is the reason why many people in the decentralised finance space are extremely bullish on the potential of decentralised derivatives that in contrast to traditional finance can be created by anyone in a completely permissionless and open way. This in turn increases the rate of innovation that has been stagnating in traditional finance. There are various derivative protocols that are emerging in the decentralised finance space. Henceforth we are going to discuss Yield Protocol, Synthetix and others.\n- Yield Protocol\n  * Yield Protocol proposes a derivative model for secured, zero-coupon bonds. This enables fixed-rate borrowing. Essentially, the protocol defines a yToken to be an ERC -20 (fungible) token that settles in some fixed quantity of a target asset at a specified date. The contract will specify that the tokens, which have the same expiry, target asset, collateral asset, and collateralization ratio, are fungible. \n  * To understand the need for a fixed rate of borrowing let us consider an example.  Suppose you think that ETH is going to appreciate by 10% over the next year. So, what you can do is deposit your ETH into let's say maker and borrow DAI. and pay 3% in terms of an interest rate. So, if the ETH goes up by 10% you can do the mathematics that well. Your assets go up by 10%. You have borrowed and you need to pay 3%. So, you've got a profit of 7%. So that works so well the problem is that that rate that's 3% is not set in stone. They can change. And if that rate for example went to 10% then even if the maker goes up in value. You have to pay the 10% and you make nothing. Hence there is a need for a fixed rate of borrowing.\n  * The tokens are secured by the collateral asset and have a required maintenance collateralization ratio similar to, for example, MakerDAO and other DeFi platforms. If the collateral’s value dips below the maintenance requirement, the position can be liquidated by a keeper with some or all of the collateral sold to cover the debt.\n  * The Yield Protocol can be used to speculate on interest rates. There exist a few DAI derivative assets that represent a variable interest rate (Compound cDAI, Aave aDAI, Chai). One can imagine a seller of yDAI using one of these DAI derivative assets as collateral. The effect of this transaction is that the seller is paying the fixed rate on the yDAI while receiving the variable rate on the collateral. This is a bet that rates will increase. Likewise purchasing yDAI (of any collateral type) is a bet that variable rates will NOT increase beyond the fixed rate received.\n  * Yield is an important protocol that supplies fixed-rate products to Ethereum. It can be tightly integrated with protocols like MakerDAO and Compound to create robust interest-bearing applications for investors. Demand for fixed income components will grow as mainstream investors begin adopting DeFi with portfolios in need of these types of assets.\n\n- Synthetix\n  * Synthetix is one of the most important derivatives in the Defi space. Synthetix allows for the creating synthetix assets that track the price of their underlying assets. The protocol currently supports synthetic fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies and commodities that can be traded on trading platforms such as Kwenta, D hedge or paraswap.\n  * Synthetix model is based on a debt pool. In order to issue a particular synthetix asset, a user has to provide collateral in the form of the SNX token. The protocol is highly over collateralised at 500% this means that for each $500 SNX locked in the system only $100 worth synthetix assets can be issued. This is mainly to absorb any sharp price changes in the synthetix assets and the collateralization ratio will be most likely lowered in the future.\n  * Synthetix is one of the first DeFi projects leading the effort of moving to layer 2 in order to lower the gas fees and make the protocol more scalable. There is currently more than $1.8 Billion locked in the synthetix protocol, which is the biggest number across all the DeFi derivatives protocols by a wide margin.\n- UMA \n  * UMA is another protocol that enables the creation of synthetic assets. The main difference here is that UMA instead of highly overcollateralizing the protocol relies on the liquidators who are financially incentivized to find improperly collateralized positions and liquidate them.\n  * UMA’s model allows for creating priceless derivatives. This is because the model does not rely on price oracles. This in turn allows for adding a very long tail of synthetic assets that otherwise wouldn’t have a reliable price feed hence it wouldn’t be possible to create them in synthetix. There is currently over $63 Million of total value locked in UMA’s smart contracts.\n  \n- Hegic\n  * Hegic is a relatively new DeFi project that allows for trading options in a non-custodial and permissionless way. Users can buy put or call options on ETH and BT. They can also become liquidity providers and sell ETH calls and put options. Three months after the launch Hegic had almost $100 million in total value locked in the protocol, a total cumulative options trading volume of around $168 million and generated over $3.5 Million in fees. Interestingly Hegic has been developed by a single anonymous developer which shows the power of DeFi whereas in contrast to traditional finance even a single person or a small group of people can build a useful financial product.\n"

          "details": "- What are Derivatives ?\n  * Derivatives are one of the essential features of a mature financial system. As the name clearly suggests derivatives derive their value from something (asset).\n  * The price of the derivatives is the price of the underlying asset in the derivatives such as a stock, a bond, a commodity, an interest rate, a currency or a cryptocurrency.\n      \n- Uses of Derivatives\n  - Hedging\n    * A hedge is an investment that is made with the goal of lowering the risk of unfavourable changes in an asset's price. A hedge often entails taking an opposite or offsetting stake in a connected security.\n    * Hedging involves a trade-off between risk and reward; while it lowers possible danger, it also limits prospective gains.\n  \n  - Speculations\n    * Speculation, often known as speculative trading, is the act of engaging in a financial transaction that carries a considerable risk of losing value but also carries the hope of a sizable gain or other significant value. With speculation, the chance of a sizable gain or other form of compensation more than offsets the risk of loss.\n  \n  Hedging aims to lessen the risk, or volatility, associated with a security's price change as opposed to speculation, which entails seeking to profit from a security's price fluctuation.\n\n  By holding positions in an asset that are counter to those the investor currently has, hedging aims to reduce the volatility that is related to its price. Contrarily, the primary goal of speculating is to make money by placing bets on the future direction of an asset.\n"

          "details": "Financial derivatives combine usually of 4 most important parameters - Futures, Options, Swaps and Forwards.\n\n- Forwards\n  * A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a specific date in the future. It mostly serves hedging needs (insuring against price risk). \n  * You could enter into a forward contract, for instance, if you are an onion farmer who is concerned about the volatility of onion prices. A contract to sell 100 kgs of onions to Arvind @ 40 per kg on 1/1/2018.\n\n- Futures\n  * A forward contract and futures are comparable. The distinction is that futures are standardised contracts to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price in the future. Consequently, they are tradable on stock exchanges. \n  * The cost of the underlying asset determines the futures' value. Futures can be used for speculation or hedging. Buying and selling an asset with the intention of making a profit is known as speculation.\n\n- Options\n  * Two different alternatives are available. The right to buy an asset at a predetermined price on or before a given date is provided by a call option. The exercise price is the agreed-upon amount. It should be mentioned that the holder has the choice not to purchase the asset. \n  * The premium is what you pay to buy the option. It stands for the sum that the call option buyer must pay in exchange for the right, but not the responsibility, to exercise the option.\n\n- Swaps\n  * A contract known as a swap allows two parties to trade future cash flows for a specified period of time. An interest rate swap is the most typical kind of swap. Parties concur to trade interest rate payments in this. \n  * Consider a loan that Bank A issued with a variable interest rate based on the market. Interest rates will change over time. A loan with a fixed interest rate has been made by Bank B. They are able to trade their interest payments through a contract.\n\nFutures and Options are two most important types of derivatives because they are traded on exchange.\n"

Regardless of the market price at the date of expiration, the buyer or seller must buy or sell the underlying asset at the agreed-upon price.\n\n- Futures are of 5 types primarily- `Commodity Futures`, `Stock index future`, `Currency futures`, `Precious Metals`, `U.S. treasury futures`.\n\n- Futures are traded through Futures contracts on exchanges.Futures Contracts are a type of financial instrument through which a buyer can wager on the future price of a commodity or other security.These exchanges are responsible for the standardisation of various parameters in these contracts. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversees futures markets (CFTC).\n\n- Hedging through futures\n\n  * Futures can be used to hedge against price fluctuations in the underlying asset. This helps in lowering the risk of te investors.\n\n- Speculation through futures\n\n  * A trader can make predictions (speculate) about the course of a commodity's price using a futures contract. The trader is at a profit position if the price of the contract rises above the contract price before expiration.\n\n- Buyer and Seller\n\n  - `Long Contract`\n    \n    * A trader buys a long contract (long position) with an prediction that the prices of the commodity rise above the current level and they are benefitted.\n\n    * `Prices rise`- The position holder is at a profit.\n\n    * `Prices fall`- The position holder is at a loss.\n  \n  - `Short Contract`\n\n    * A trader buys a short contract (long position) with an prediction that the prices of the commodity fall below the current level and they are benefitted.\n\n    * `Prices rise`- The position holder is at a loss.\n\n    * `Prices fall`- The position holder is at a profit.\n"

          "details": "* Ever-expanding markets inevitably create their own derivatives markets, which may eventually grow to be orders of magnitude larger than their underlying markets.     \n* Due to the fact that, in contrast to traditional finance, decentralised derivatives can be generated by anybody in an entirely permissionless and open manner, many individuals in the decentralised finance field are quite optimistic about their potential.\n* There are various derivative protocols that are emerging in the decentralised finance space. Henceforth we are going to discuss Yield Protocol, Synthetix and others.\n\n- Yield Protocol\n  * A protocol for collateralized fixed-rate, fixed-term borrowing and lending called Yield Protocol is built on Ethereum. Yield employs a class of tokens known as fyTokens to accomplish its objectives (fixed yield tokens). \n  * After a defined maturity date, fyTokens are Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens that can be exchanged for an underlying asset. For instance, following the maturity date, you can exchange one fyDai token for one Dai.\n  * Yield is a crucial protocol that gives Ethereum access to fixed-rate goods. To build strong interest-bearing apps for investors, it can be strongly connected with protocols like MakerDAO and Compound. \n  * As more traditional investors start using DeFi and their portfolios start to require these kinds of assets, the demand for fixed income components will increase.\n\n- Synthetix\n  * On the Ethereum blockchain, synthetic assets can be issued via the Synthetix (SNX) protocol. Gold and silver-like synthetic commodities, synthetic cryptocurrencies, inverse synthetic cryptocurrencies, synthetic cryptocurrency indexes, and synthetic fiat currencies are all supported by Synthetix. The platform exposes non-blockchain-based assets to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, resulting in the development of a more developed financial market.\n  * A synthetic asset issuance protocol built on Ethereum is called Synthetix. Synthetic assets are financial instruments in the form of ERC-20 smart contracts known as \"Synths,\" which track and give the returns of another asset without requiring you to retain that asset. \n  * They are comparable to derivatives in traditional finance. On Kwenta, Synthetix's decentralised exchange, you can trade Synths, which include cryptocurrencies, indices, inverses, and physical assets like gold (DEX). The Synthetix Network Token (SNX), the company's native token, is utilised as collateral for issued Synths.\n\n- UMA \n  * A blockchain-based open-source protocol called UMA uses Ethereum (ETH). Anyone can create decentralised financial products—financial services that are available to everyone—using UMA. Also, the team's objective of establishing \"universal market access\" is where the protocol's name, UMA, originates.\n  * The UMA protocol, which is supported by the UMA token, enables users to create their own synthetic assets—digital tokens that simulate and track the value of any physical item. On the platform, these digital assets are also referred to as priceless financial contracts. According to the UMA protocol, decentralised financial contracts have the ability to remove all entry barriers for any financial market\n  \n- Hegic\n  * In a trustless way, Hegic, a decentralised trading system built on the Ethereum blockchain, establishes, maintains, and settles Hedge contracts. The hedge contracts are on-chain contracts that resemble options and let traders sell their assets at a predetermined price at a later time. On the Hegic platform, option prices are automatically set lower than they are on centralised exchanges.\n"

          "details": "### Introduction\nCryptocurrencies are still mostly utilized for speculation despite the growth in price and interest. Many people are \nhesitant to use digital currencies in regular transactions, such as purchasing products or services, because of \nfrequent spikes and falls as well as daily changes.\nBlockchain-based modern financial systems require a steady means of exchange and a currency that is actually stable.\n\nIntroducing the stablecoin, a completely new way to think about the concept of digital currency.\n\n### Stablecoins: Unlocking the Power of the Blockchain\nUsing the value of an underlying asset, such as the U.S. dollar, stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that aim \nto keep their price stable over time. Hence we can say, a cryptocurrency with a fixed price can be referred to as a \nstablecoin. \n\nA stablecoin is a digital currency that is pegged to a “stable” reserve asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. Stablecoins \nare designed to reduce volatility relative to unpegged cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nThe daily swings of a cryptocurrency are no longer a factor in the decision to buy something. Stability enables people \nto transact in a practical fashion throughout the short and long term, and it also supports other crucial financial \noperations like loans and credit.\n\nAs stablecoins become more widely used, that will be the real key to releasing blockchain's tremendous potential.\n\n### Why StableCoins?\nWith the launch of stablecoins, the possibility to hold and use a cryptocurrency with a stable price was finally \nprovided. Trading on centralized exchanges was the first important use case for stablecoins. Finally, traders could \nexchange assets against a token that is not volatile and has the ability to store value. The rise of defi has resulted \nin a surge in demand for cryptocurrencies that ensure price stability. \n\nStablecoins lack the volatility of non-pegged cryptocurrencies while retaining some of their most potent features:\n- Stablecoins are open, worldwide, and available to everyone on the internet at any time.\n- They transmit quickly, cheaply, and securely.\n- They are digitally native to the Internet and may be programmed.\n\n### What can you do with stablecoins?\n- Reduce volatility. The value of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether changes dramatically, sometimes even by \n  the minute. An asset linked to a more stable currency can provide buyers and sellers with confidence that the value \n  of their tokens will neither surge nor fall unexpectedly in the near future.\n\n- Sell or keep your assets. Stablecoins do not require a bank account to hold, and they are simple to transfer.

          "details": "### The StableCoin Trilemma\nNewcomers to the space of decentralized finance and the stablecoin market might be perplexed as to why there are so \nmany distinct stablecoins accessible to use when they all only offer the usefulness of being a cryptocurrency \nthat is (relatively) stable.\n\nA stablecoin must now strike a balance between three major objectives, namely, price stability, decentralization, \nand capital efficiency. A stablecoin's principal objective and goal are to maintain a stable value correlated to the \nvalue of another asset, such as a fiat currency. Various price-stability mechanisms can be used to attain this price \nstability. The stablecoin's issuer frequently requests collateral, which may be in the form of real money or digital \nassets. \n\nThe more effectively the stablecoin achieves its goal, the lower its achieved volatility. However, the majority of \nstablecoin designs trade off either the system's decentralization or its capital efficiency in order to attain great \nprice stability.\n![Trilemma](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-defi-course/e84d2833e8d447fbd9bdca6dd26b4a1cacca5228/images/trilemma.png?raw=true)\n`Reference: https://stablecoins.wtf/`\n\n### Tackling the Trillema\nA trilemma's inherent property is that none of the three objectives can ever be accomplished concurrently. The \nprimary goal of stablecoins is still price stability. The peg has been held pretty successfully over the past few \nyears by centralized fiat-backed & decentralized overcollateralized stablecoins. However, each makes a significant \nconcession in one of the other two dimensions of the trilemma. So far, a wide range of design strategies has been \nused to address the trilemma and attain all three desired features. Some of these algorithmic stablecoins were able \nto solve the trilemma for a brief period of time until the market's workings once more exposed their weaknesses.\n\n### Various Types Have Emerged\nFiat-backed stablecoins, like USDT from Tether, were the first stablecoins to gain widespread use. As implied by the \nname, all stablecoins in this category are linked to the value of a fiat currency. Due to its status as the world's \nreserve currency, the USD is typically the preferred option. However, the stablecoin issuer needs a centralized \nbanking system in order to back the token with real Fiat money, such as USD. The level of centralization that resulted, \ntogether with the fact that some fiat-backed stablecoins lacked information on the fiat reserves held in bank accounts, \nhelped on-chain and crypto-backed stablecoins like MakerDAO's Dai to take off. In decentralized protocols, crypto-backed \nstablecoins are often only created if the value of the collateral is greater than the value of the stablecoins. In order \nto guarantee that the stablecoins are always fully backed by the value of the crypto assets, the protocol takes the \nvolatility of the collateral into consideration. This technique achieves high stability, but capital efficiency is \nlow. This inefficiency gave algorithmic stablecoins a chance to take off. UST is the most well-known illustration of \nan algorithmic stablecoin. In order to balance supply and demand and provide price stability, its peg was made using \na mint and burn algorithm. However, in May of this year, UST suffered a significant crash. This has demonstrated that \nunder hostile circumstances, its mechanism is unable to keep the peg in place.\n"

Each USD-pegged token issued by fiat-backed stablecoins is backed 1:1 by actual US \ndollars. Basically an IOU (I owe you) for a traditional fiat currency (usually dollars). Fiat-backed stablecoins must \ntherefore be backed by bank accounts that contain USD. As a result, the old financial system's centralized structure \nand regulated institutions are used by fiat-backed stablecoin issuers. However, despite the unique properties of \nstablecoins and blockchain technology, the activity of producing stablecoins is not specifically regulated by any \nfinancial institution. Due to this, stablecoin issuers have poor levels of transparency, which makes it difficult for \ninvestors and consumers to put their trust in them.\n\nThe most well-known fiat-backed stablecoin is Tether Holdings' USDT. In order to counteract the extreme volatility \nin the cryptocurrency markets, USDT is primarily utilized for trading on both centralized and decentralized exchanges \nas well as a store of wealth. USDT is one of the most reliable and durable stablecoins on the market, thanks to its \ndirect backing with fiat money. Based on the success of USDT, other new fiat-backed stablecoins have entered the \nmarket, including USDC from Circle and BUSD from Binance. \n\nStablecoins backed by fiat have a high level of stability, but decentralization and capital efficiency suffer as a result.\n\n![Fiat-backed](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-defi-course/blob/e84d2833e8d447fbd9bdca6dd26b4a1cacca5228/images/fiat-backed.png?raw=true)\n\n`Reference: https://stablecoins.wtf/`\n\n- Pros\n  * Safe against crypto volatility.\n  * Changes in price are minimal i.e. high level of stability\n  * Ideal issuer for big and institutional investors entering the cryptocurrency markets since they can produce stablecoins based on actual USD\n  * Serve as a point of entry for professional capital and support future market expansion.\n\n- Cons\n  * Centralized i.e. someone must issue the tokens.\n  * Requires auditing to ensure the company has sufficient reserves.\n  * Suppliers' lack of transparency and accountability.\n  * Customers must go through an AML and KYC process in order to borrow stablecoins against USD\n"

          "details": "The drawbacks and compromises of centralized fiat-backed stablecoins are addressed by crypto-backed stablecoins. \nDecentralized on-chain stablecoin protocols had to be developed since trustless systems and decentralization are the \nfoundations of the crypto ecosystem. These stablecoins are often generated using decentralized protocols to issue and \nredeem the tokens and are backed by other digital assets like BTC, ETH, other tokens, or any tokenized asset. In order \nto produce or mint new stablecoins, digital assets are thus locked as collateral in smart contracts. DAI from MakerDAO \nis a well-known illustration of a stablecoin backed by cryptocurrency. On-chain stablecoin methods use an open-source \nmethodology, which has sped up innovation and increased competition in this market.\n\nBecause the underlying crypto's value can fluctuate, these stablecoins are overcollateralized to ensure the price \nstays as stable as possible. This makes it more accurate to state that a stablecoin with a crypto asset backing of \n$1 has an underlying asset worth at least $2. Therefore, if crypto prices fall, more crypto must be used to back the \nstablecoin; otherwise, the stablecoins' value would decrease.\n\nSome stablecoin protocols are accepting other stablecoins with deep liquidity, such as USDC, as on-chain collateral \nin order to reduce the necessary collateralization ratio without sacrificing price stability. As a result, the \ncollateral has less volatility, which lowers the chance of a large decline in its value. Two excellent instances of \nthis are DAI and FRAX.\n\nTake, for example, Dai (DAI). This stablecoin can be borrowed from the MakerDAO lending platform in exchange for \nsome crypto collateral. Users can use Ethereum (ETH), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Compound Token (COMP), and USD Coin \nat the moment (USDC). Anyone who wants to borrow DAI must put up greater collateral than they are borrowing. Furthermore, \nif their collateral loses too much value while being placed, they may be forced to liquidate it and return the borrowed DAI.\n\n![Crypto-backed](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-defi-course/blob/e84d2833e8d447fbd9bdca6dd26b4a1cacca5228/images/crypto-backed.png?raw=true)\n\n`Reference: https://stablecoins.wtf/`\n\n- Pros\n  * Transparent and fully decentralized.\n  * Quick to turn into other crypto assets.\n  * No external custodians i.e. all assets are controlled by Ethereum accounts.\n\n- Cons\n  * Less stable than fiat-backed stablecoins.\n  * Volatile, You need to keep an eye on the value of the crypto collateral.\n  * Due to the volatility of the collateral, most crypto-backed stablecoins are over-collateralized in order to account for it\n"

Even real estate can be used as collateral for this kind of stablecoin. The \ncoins may or may not be redeemable for the physical asset. In a sense, commodity-backed stablecoins are a digital \nrepresentation of a valuable real-world asset. But why would anyone need this?\n\nCommodity-backed stablecoins are particularly useful for those who find it difficult to get their hands on literal \nprecious materials but still want to invest in them. Investing in a commodity-backed stablecoin, say one that is \nbacked by gold, gives an investor something that holds the same value as the collateral and can be liquidated when \ndesired. And, because the value of these assets isn't nearly as volatile as that of fiat or cryptocurrencies, \ninvesting in commodity-backed stablecoins can be a safer route.\n\nGold is generally the most popular collateral to use for commodity-backed stablecoins. Take Paxos Gold (PAXG), for \nexample. The value of one PAXG is pegged 1:1 to the value of one fine troy ounce of a London Good Delivery gold bar.\n\nTether Gold (XAUt) is another example of a gold-backed stablecoin.

On-chain collateral or conventional off-chain \ncollateral are not used in this approach. Instead, the value of a second token serves as collateral for the stablecoin. \n\nUsually, a mint and burn mechanism for a second, price-floating token balances a two-token scheme with two tokens. Investors \nwill always be able to exchange one stablecoin for one dollar of the price-floating token thanks to the protocol. Arbitrageurs are \nthus encouraged to purchase stablecoins on the open market and trade them for price-floating tokens if they are trading below \nthe peg or vice versa. \n\nIn the event that investors choose to exchange their stablecoins, the protocol creates a new price-floating token \nwhile the stablecoin supply fluctuates. Since there is no other asset backing these stablecoins, if the price drops \nbelow the targeted level, an algorithm will sell tokens, and if the price rises above the acceptable level, it will \nsupply tokens.

These show \nup as three fundamental design issues that affect defi as a whole. First, is technical security, which pertains to \natomic or almost immediate risks-free exploits of technical structure. Second, there is the issue of economic \nsecurity, which entails the risky manipulation of market equilibrium over time. Thirdly, the issue of economic stability \nasks whether stable outcomes are genuinely produced by incentives when a protocol is secure. \n\nTechnical security entails exploits that are atomic and immediate in nature, and hence risk-free because the outcomes \nare binary for the attacker: either the attack is successful and the attacker profits or it does not occur at all. The \ntransaction is reversed, and the attacker is merely required to pay the petrol fees. Examples include atomic mev, \nsandwich attacks, reentrancy, and logic bugs, which are fortunately fairly well studied at this point and can be \nbest addressed using program analysis and formal models to just formally specify different protocols, and most attacks \nactually fit into this category, and there are many examples. Economic security leverages both technological structure \nand economic equilibrium over time, and they are not risk-free for an attacker because conducting this manipulation \nhas actual upfront costs. There's a chance that the attack will fail and misestimate the market itself, and you won't \nbe able to recover these upfront costs because the attack is not atomic in nature. These are less well studied and \ninclude things like governance extractable value, mev reorg attacks, and market manipulation exploits, and in order \nto address these, we need economic models of how these systems and agents work. A good example of the concept is when, \nin November 2020, the price of DAI on the Coinbase exchange spiked from its usual level of around $1 to $ 1.30 and \nheld that position for only a few minutes. This price was then incorporated into the price of the Compound Protocol, \nwhich caused 88 million dollars in liquidations on Compound. It's possible that someone tried to manipulate the DAI \nmarket on Coinbase in order to cause and profit from these liquidations because these liquidations provide arbitrage \nopportunities.\n\n### Terra Luna Crash\nThe past meltdown of UST (an algorithmic stablecoin) highlighted the dangers of algorithmic stablecoins. Over \n$40 billion was lost as a result of the collapse in May 2022. Many retail investors, DAOs, and protocols experienced \nlarge losses, and the UST bubble brought down the whole crypto market. The entire chain of events has heightened \nregulators' and authorities' efforts to find a solution for stablecoin regulation. The stablecoin market will alter \nonce genuine restrictions are implemented in large countries such as the United States or the European Union.\n\nNot all recent market developments have been bad. Stablecoins backed by fiat have kept their peg and are regarded as \nsafe havens, which is evidence of how well they were built.\n\nSo what really happened? Stablecoins were hit by a larger crypto sell-off that occurred shortly after the US Federal \nReserve boosted interest rates. With rising economic uncertainty and greater inflation, investors switched their \nportfolios away from risky assets such as stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies. Then Luna's meltdown and UST \nde-pegging pulled down the broader crypto markets.\n\nTerra, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, has its own blockchain. Its principal product is the UST, an algorithmic stablecoin \ntied to the dollar that is maintained by code, constant market activity, and conviction. The theoretical support for \nUST's peg was also provided by its computational link to Terra's basic currency, Luna.\n\nAlgorithmic stablecoins operate via an arbitrage-encouraging mechanism. It is essentially game theory. People can \npurchase 1 UST, for instance, at 98 cents and receive $1 worth of Luna, making a 2-cent profit. They can exchange \n$1 Luna for $1 UST and make a profit of 2 cents if 1 UST is up to $1.02.\n\nThe \"value\" of UST came from a lending platform called Anchor, which gave buyers of UST who lent it to the protocol \na 19.5 percent yield. In addition, Terra had other defenses in place to protect its peg, such as a backup of billions \nof dollars worth of Bitcoin.\n\nWhat transpired, then? a downward spiral\nAccording to some experts, wealthy investors short-sold the Terra stablecoin in an effort to attack it. They borrowed \nlarge amounts of Bitcoin in order to purchase UST with the goal of making enormous profits when the value of UST fell \nafter selling all of their Bitcoin to the market to cause a larger panic. Because of this, UST's peg to the dollar \nwas broken, which resulted to a bank run as investors who had earned interest through Anchor rushed to cash out \nbefore the connected token Luna also plummeted.\n\nAfter being worth as much as $116 in April, UST is now only worth 0.03 cents, while Luna is only worth a few \nhundredths of a penny.\n"

The UST crash demonstrated the significant danger involved with algorithmic \nstablecoins. Due to the meltdown, not only UST but also other algorithmic stablecoins lost their peg and suffered \nlarge market cap losses. Hybrid stablecoins acquire more traction as a response. These stablecoin systems combine \non-chain crypto-based collateralization with an effective mint and burn mechanism. As a result, the dangers of a \ncomplete crash, such as in the case of UST, are diminished while the capital efficiency continues to be higher than \nfor stablecoins that are only backed by cash and cryptocurrency. The hybrid-backed stablecoin FRAX from Frax Finance \nis an illustration of this. \n\nAs stablecoin payment infrastructure spreads across continents and many governments have already started working \ntoward some kind of regulation. It is anticipated that the impact of digital wallets will grow over time as they \nincrease access to financial services for underbanked people.\n\n### Regulations ahead?\n#### Regulation and central bank digital currencies will have a significant impact on the stablecoin landscape.\nStablecoins have been a major topic of discussion among US legislators as they consider measures to regulate the \ncryptocurrency market. A hard cap on the daily activity of huge stablecoins is something that the European Commission \nis considering doing across the pond.\n\nStablecoins require regulation as they are \"backed by assets that may lose value or become illiquid during stress\" \nand are \"susceptible to runs,\" according to research by the US Federal Reserve.\n\nAccording to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the de-pegging of the UST underscores the need for a stablecoin regulatory framework.\n\nInstead, a lot of people think CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) will close the stablecoin market's gap. The \nBank for International Settlements estimates that 90% of all central banks are actively investigating and testing CBDCs.\n  \nCBDCs will be completely convertible to other kinds of legal tender currency, unlike stablecoins, which will not \nhave the same status as central bank money.\n\nThe majority of stablecoins are now issued by private enterprises, but this will change as central banks issue their own, \nknown as CBDCs (central bank digital currencies).\n\nIn March 2022, US President Biden signed an executive order establishing a framework for regulators to follow in \nestablishing a Federal Reserve (Fed) CBDC. The findings are due later this year.\n\nThe eurozone is slightly ahead, although it is still in the experimental stage. The European Central Bank has stated \nthat smart contracts will almost certainly be incorporated into a digital euro. Since 2020, the Bank of England has \nbeen working with HM Treasury to develop a sterling CBDC. A consultation process is now underway to assess the primary \nissues. It is expected that the first sterling CBDC will appear in the middle of this decade.\n\nMany countries are currently conducting research. In an ideal world, CBDCs would be able to communicate with one \nanother. The Bank of International Settlements is currently testing this on a shared platform with four central banks. \nIt is worth mentioning that, similar to how the Eurodollar banking system works, an offshore commercially-issued USD \nstablecoin can exist regardless of what US regulators decide. Eurodollar deposits are denominated in dollars and \nare not regulated in the United States. The choice is not binary, and the final question in terms of innovation is \ndesign. A CBDC and a commercial stablecoin can both be used to innovate.\n"

          "details": "- What are stable coins?\n  * A stablecoin is a digital currency that is pegged to a “stable” reserve asset like the U.S. dollar or gold.\n  * Using the value of an underlying asset, such as the U.S. dollar, stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that aim to keep their price stable over time.    \n  * Stablecoins are designed to reduce volatility relative to unpegged cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\n- Why stable coins?\n  * Stability enables people to transact in a practical fashion throughout the short and long term, and it also supports other crucial financial operations like loans and credit.\n  * The daily swings of a cryptocurrency are no longer a factor in the decision to buy something.\n  * Trading on centralized exchanges was the first important use case for stablecoins.\n  * Finally, traders could exchange assets against a token that is not volatile and has the ability to store value.\n  * Stablecoins lack the volatility of non-pegged cryptocurrencies while retaining some of their most potent features:\n    - Stablecoins are open, worldwide, and available to everyone on the internet at any time.\n    - They transmit quickly, cheaply, and securely.\n    - They are digitally native to the Internet and may be programmed.\n\n- Key features of stable coins\n  * Reduce volatility. The value of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether changes dramatically, sometimes even by the minute. An asset linked to a more stable currency can provide buyers and sellers with confidence that the value of their tokens will neither surge nor fall unexpectedly in the near future.\n  * Sell or keep your assets. Stablecoins do not require a bank account to hold, and they are simple to transfer. The value of stablecoins can be easily transferred around the world, especially to regions where the US dollar is difficult to get or if the local currency is unstable.\n  * Profit from interest. There are simple ways to generate interest on a stablecoin investment that is often higher than what a bank would offer.\n  * Global processing. Stablecoins like USDC are a fantastic alternative for sending money anywhere in the world because of their fast processing and cheap transaction fees.\n  * Low-cost money transfer. Individuals have transferred as much as a million dollars in USDC for as little as a dollar in transfer fees.\n"

          "details": "- The Stable Coin Trilemma \n  * A stablecoin must now strike a balance between three major objectives, namely, price stability, decentralization, and capital efficiency.\n  * A stablecoin's principal objective and goal are to maintain a stable value correlated to the value of another asset, such as a fiat currency. Various price-stability mechanisms can be used to attain this price stability.\n  * The more effectively the stablecoin achieves its goal, the lower its achieved volatility.\n  * However, the majority of stablecoin designs trade off either the system's decentralization or its capital efficiency in order to attain great price stability.\n  * A trilemma's inherent property is that none of the three objectives can ever be accomplished concurrently. \n  * The peg has been held pretty successfully over the past few years by centralized fiat-backed & decentralized overcollateralized stablecoins. \n  * However, each makes a significant concession in one of the other two dimensions of the trilemma. \n  * So far, a wide range of design strategies has been used to address the trilemma and attain all three desired features. \n  * Some of these algorithmic stablecoins were able to solve the trilemma for a brief period of time until the market's workings once more exposed their weaknesses.\n\n- Various Types Have Emerged\n  * Fiat-backed stablecoins, like USDT from Tether, were the first stablecoins to gain widespread use.\n  * However, the stablecoin issuer needs a centralized banking system in order to back the token with real Fiat money, such as USD.\n  * The level of centralization that resulted, together with the fact that some fiat-backed stablecoins lacked information on the fiat reserves held in bank accounts, helped on-chain and crypto-backed stablecoins like MakerDAO's Dai to take off.\n  * In decentralized protocols, crypto-backed stablecoins are often only created if the value of the collateral is greater than the value of the stablecoins.\n  * In order to guarantee that the stablecoins are always fully backed by the value of the crypto assets, the protocol takes the volatility of the collateral into consideration. \n  * This technique achieves high stability, but capital efficiency is low. This inefficiency gave algorithmic stablecoins a chance to take off.\n"

          "details": "* Since their introduction in 2014, fiat-backed stablecoins have grown in popularity and usage. \n* They were the first stablecoins to appear. \n* Each USD-pegged token issued by fiat-backed stablecoins is backed 1:1 by actual US dollars.\n* Basically an IOU (I owe you) for a traditional fiat currency (usually dollars). \n* Fiat-backed stablecoins must therefore be backed by bank accounts that contain USD. \n* As a result, the old financial system's centralized structure and regulated institutions are used by fiat-backed stablecoin issuers. \n* However, despite the unique properties of stablecoins and blockchain technology, the activity of producing stablecoins is not specifically regulated by any financial institution. \n* Stablecoins backed by fiat have a high level of stability, but decentralization and capital efficiency suffer as a result.\n* Due to this, stablecoin issuers have poor levels of transparency, which makes it difficult for investors and consumers to put their trust in them.\n* The most well-known fiat-backed stablecoin is Tether Holdings' USDT. \n* In order to counteract the extreme volatility in the cryptocurrency markets, USDT is primarily utilized for trading on both centralized and decentralized exchanges as well as a store of wealth. \n* USDT is one of the most reliable and durable stablecoins on the market, thanks to its direct backing with fiat money. \n* Based on the success of USDT, other new fiat-backed stablecoins have entered the market, including USDC from Circle and BUSD from Binance. \n\n- Pros\n  * Safe against crypto volatility.\n  * Changes in price are minimal i.e. high level of stability\n  * Ideal issuer for big and institutional investors entering the cryptocurrency markets since they can produce stablecoins based on actual USD\n  * Serve as a point of entry for professional capital and support future market expansion.\n\n- Cons\n  * Centralized i.e. someone must issue the tokens.\n  * Requires auditing to ensure the company has sufficient reserves.\n  * Suppliers' lack of transparency and accountability.\n  * Customers must go through an AML and KYC process in order to borrow stablecoins against USD\n"

          "details": "* The drawbacks and compromises of centralized fiat-backed stablecoins are addressed by crypto-backed stablecoins. \n* Decentralized on-chain stablecoin protocols had to be developed since trustless systems and decentralization are the foundations of the crypto ecosystem. \n* These stablecoins are often generated using decentralized protocols to issue and redeem the tokens and are backed by other digital assets like BTC, ETH, other tokens, or any tokenized asset. \n* In order to produce or mint new stablecoins, digital assets are thus locked as collateral in smart contracts. \n* DAI from MakerDAO is a well-known illustration of a stablecoin backed by cryptocurrency. \n* On-chain stablecoin methods use an open-source methodology, which has sped up innovation and increased competition in this market.\n* Because the underlying crypto's value can fluctuate, these stablecoins are overcollateralized to ensure the price stays as stable as possible. \n* This makes it more accurate to state that a stablecoin with a crypto asset backing of $1 has an underlying asset worth at least $2. \n* Therefore, if crypto prices fall, more crypto must be used to back the stablecoin, otherwise, the stablecoins' value would decrease.\n* Some stablecoin protocols are accepting other stablecoins with deep liquidity, such as USDC, as on-chain collateral in order to reduce the necessary collateralization ratio without sacrificing price stability. \n* As a result, the collateral has less volatility, which lowers the chance of a large decline in its value. Two excellent instances of this are DAI and FRAX.\n\n- Pros\n  * Transparent and fully decentralized.\n  * Quick to turn into other crypto assets.\n  * No external custodians i.e. all assets are controlled by Ethereum accounts.\n\n- Cons\n  * Less stable than fiat-backed stablecoins.\n  * Volatile, You need to keep an eye on the value of the crypto collateral.\n  * Due to the volatility of the collateral, most crypto-backed stablecoins are over-collateralized in order to account for it\n"

The value of one PAXG is pegged 1:1 to the value of one fine troy ounce of a London Good Delivery gold bar.\n* Tether Gold (XAUt) is another example of a gold-backed stablecoin.

          "key": "algorithmic",
          "details": "* Algorithmic stablecoins do not use fiat or cryptocurrency as collateral. Instead, their price stability results from the use of specialized algorithms and smart contracts that manage the supply of tokens in circulation.\n* Algorithmic stablecoins differ from most stablecoins in that these processes are included in the protocol and made accessible to everyone on the blockchain.\n* Rebase. Stablecoins that use rebase algorithms to maintain the peg alter the base supply. \n* In proportion to the coin's price deviation from the peg (the price of the fiat currency it follows), the protocol mints (additionally adds) or burns (removes) supply from circulation. \n* When the market price falls below the price of the fiat currency it follows, an algorithmic stablecoin system reduces the number of tokens in circulation. \n* If the token's price exceeds the price of the fiat currency it follows, fresh tokens enter the circulation to reduce the stablecoin's value. \n* Coins are minted into or destroyed from the wallets of coin holders. The number of these tokens a holder owns will fluctuate, but their wallet will always reflect the share because the quantity in circulation fluctuates frequently.\n\n* Seigniorage. Seigniorage algorithmic stablecoins employ a multi-coin system in which the price of one currency is designed to be stable and the price of at least one other coin is designed to promote that stability. \n* Seigniorage methods often use a combination of protocol-based mint-and-burn processes and free market mechanisms to incentivize market participants to buy or sell non-stablecoins in order to drive the stablecoin's price closer to its peg. \n* Usually, a mint and burn mechanism for a second, price-floating token balances a two-token scheme with two tokens. \n* Arbitrageurs are thus encouraged to purchase stablecoins on the open market and trade them for price-floating tokens if they are trading below the peg or vice versa. \n* In the event that investors choose to sell-off their stablecoins, the protocol creates new price-floating tokens while the stablecoin supply fluctuates.\n\n* A third type, fractional-algorithmic stablecoins, is gaining popularity. \n* Part seigniorage, part collateralized, fractional algorithmic stablecoins seek to hold their value by integrating the finest mechanisms from \"pure\" uncollateralized stablecoins and their collateralized equivalents. This model was pioneered by Frax Finance. \n* DAI, FRAX, and Ampleforth are some of the well-known examples.\n\n- Pros\n  * No collateral is needed.\n  * Controlled by a public algorithm.\n\n- Cons\n  * You need to trust (or be able to read) the algorithm.\n  * Your balance of coins will change based on the total supply.\n"

Its principal product is the UST, an algorithmic stablecoin tied to the dollar that is maintained by code, constant market activity, and conviction. \n  * The theoretical support for UST's peg was also provided by its computational link to Terra's basic currency, Luna.\n  * Algorithmic stablecoins operate via an arbitrage-encouraging mechanism. It is essentially game theory. \n  * People can purchase 1 UST, for instance, at 98 cents and receive $1 worth of Luna, making a 2-cent profit. They can exchange $1 Luna for $1 UST and make a profit of 2 cents if 1 UST is up to $1.02.\n  * The \"value\" of UST came from a lending platform called Anchor, which gave buyers of UST who lent it to the protocol a 19.5 percent yield. \n  * In addition, Terra had other defenses in place to protect its peg, such as a backup of billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.\n  * What transpired, then? a downward spiral. According to some experts, wealthy investors short-sold the Terra stablecoin in an effort to attack it. \n  * They borrowed large amounts of Bitcoin in order to purchase UST with the goal of making enormous profits when the value of UST fell after selling all of their Bitcoin to the market to cause a larger panic. \n  * Because of this, UST's peg to the dollar was broken, which resulted to a bank run as investors who had earned interest through Anchor rushed to cash out before the connected token Luna also plummeted.\n"

Since 2020, the Bank of England has been working with HM Treasury to develop a sterling CBDC.\n  * It is expected that the first sterling CBDC will appear in the middle of this decade.\n  * Many countries are currently conducting research.
