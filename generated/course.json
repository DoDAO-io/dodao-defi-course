This puts a negative impact on growth.\n\n- Inefficiency\n  * Banks charge 3% for a credit card swipe\n  * 5-7% is charged for a wire transfer\n  * It takes 2 days to settle a stock transaction\n  * Fund transfer is slow\n  * Banks are prone to fauds, chargebanks and lack security as well.\n  * Banks do not allow micro-transitions.\n  * It is difficult to get paid using banks.\n\n- Lack of Interoperability\n  * Institutions are isolated from each other and have no interlinking.\n  * It is difficult to move funds from one bank to another.\n  * Difficult to move money from a bank to non bank.\n  \n- Opacity\n  * Banking institutions have very little transparency.\n  * Bank customers do not know the health of the bank.\n  * Individuals are forced to rely on costly regulation and promise of bailouts.\n\nThese problems when not tackled lead to following destructive effects.\n\n- Missed Growth Opportunities\n  * Entrepreneurs who have suppose 25% ROI on their great idea, but their project is not executed due to high cost of credit card borrowing.\n  * High ROI project fuels high CAPEX, strong real GDP growth, and robust employment growth.\n\n- Inequality of opportunities\n  * Projects should be financed based on the quality of the idea and the soundness of the execution plan.\n  * Many have no access to internet commerce (to buy or sell).\n  * Given the number of unbanked and underbanked, this creates unequal opportunities and perpetuates or even exacerbates inequality.\n"

Or rent something by the second like a storage locker or electric scooter.\n\n- Access to stablecoins\n  * Volatility in the cryptocurrency is of huge concern which hinders its growth as well.\n  * DeFi community has introduced stablecoins.\n  * Their value remains peggged to another asset, usually a popular currency like dollar.\n  * Coins like Dai or USDC have a value that stays within a few cents of a dollar.\n\n- Borrowing \n  * DeFi helps in borrowing money with privacy. \n  * The borrower must put up collateral that the lender will automatically receive if their loan is not repaid. \n  * This allows you to borrow money without credit checks or handing over private information.\n\n- Flash loans\n  * DeFi introduced the concept of flash loans where the borrower gets loans without handling any collateral to lender.\n  * If the borrower is not able to pay the loan, the transaction is reversed as if it never occured.\n\n- Tokenization\n  * DeFi intriduces the concepts of crypto tokens.\n  * Ethereum enables robust smart contract capabilities, thereby opening up the roads for issuing crypto tokens. \n  * Crypto tokens basically worked as digital assets present on a blockchain alongside having different features and uses.\n  \n  \n"

They invented this technique for efficient time-stamping of digital documents.\n  * Adam Back in 2002 invents the idea of Proof of Work idea.\n  * Proof of Work was based on the paper work by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor (1992) that was aimed at eliminating junk mail.\n  * The sender needs to do some computational task before sending the mail. This was easy to do when done once but becomes infeasible to do for millions of recipients.\n  * Moreover, Blockchain is not Bitcoin rather Bitcoin employs the technology of Blockchain.  \n"

This ledger is quickly and easily accessbile by anyone and further shared by many which explains its distributive nature.\n  * These ledgers are responsible for process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.\n  * These are responsible for storing data and assets such as tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).\n  * Blockchain ledger is distributed. All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions.\n  * Due to this distributed mechanism the transactions are recorded only for once, eliminating the duplication of data something which is very frequent in traditional business mechanisms.\n  * Tampering or changing these transactions in the ledger is impossible for a particiapnt to do so.\n  * Thus, these records ensure proper immutability.\n\n- Blockchain Transactions and Blocks\n  * Whenever a transaction occurs it is stored as a \"block\" of data.\n  * These transactions show the movement of assets tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual).\n  * These data blocks store a variety of information such as who, what, when, where and also conditions such as temperature.\n  * Each block is connected to one before and after it. The blocks represent the flow of ownership of some data.\n  * Each of these blocks have a hashed reference to the block before it so you can trace every transaction all the way back to genesis block.\n  * These block are securely linked to each other to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.\n  * Blockchain hashes are highly secure. They strengthen the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain.\n"

But it is impossible to eliminate collissions completely. Algorithms like MD5 , SHA-1 are known to contain collsions-produce same hash value for two different input credentials.\n  * Rainbow tables are “optimized lookup tables” that can be used to reverse-engineer one-way hash functions. A rainbow table is basically a pre-computed set of plaintext strings and their corresponding hashes.\n  *  Large rainbow tables are publicly available, and attackers can use one of these tables to retrieve cleartext data that has been hashed.\n"

They invented this technique for efficient time-stamping of digital documents.\n  * Adam Back in 2002 invents the idea of Proof of Work idea.\n  * Proof of Work was based on the paper work by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor (1992) that was aimed at eliminating junk mail.\n  * The sender needs to do some computational task before sending the mail. This was easy to do when done once but becomes infeasible to do for millions of recipients.\n  * Moreover, Blockchain is not Bitcoin rather Bitcoin employs the technology of Blockchain.  \n"

This ledger is quickly and easily accessbile by anyone and further shared by many which explains its distributive nature.\n  * These ledgers are responsible for process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.\n  * These are responsible for storing data and assets such as tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).\n  * Blockchain ledger is distributed. All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions.\n  * Due to this distributed mechanism the transactions are recorded only for once, eliminating the duplication of data something which is very frequent in traditional business mechanisms.\n  * Tampering or changing these transactions in the ledger is impossible for a particiapnt to do so.\n  * Thus, these records ensure proper immutability.\n\n- Blockchain Transactions and Blocks\n  * Whenever a transaction occurs it is stored as a \"block\" of data.\n  * These transactions show the movement of assets tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual).\n  * These data blocks store a variety of information such as who, what, when, where and also conditions such as temperature.\n  * Each block is connected to one before and after it. The blocks represent the flow of ownership of some data.\n  * Each of these blocks have a hashed reference to the block before it so you can trace every transaction all the way back to genesis block.\n  * These block are securely linked to each other to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.\n  * Blockchain hashes are highly secure. They strengthen the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain.\n"

Thus hashing creates great deal of security. \n\n- The Bad Effects\n  * Attackers who have fast hardware can easily \"crack\" hash values to original text.\n  * Good hash alogrithms are made to be collission resistant. But it is impossible to eliminate collissions completely. Algorithms like MD5 , SHA-1 are known to contain collsions-produce same hash value for two different input credentials.\n  * Rainbow tables are “optimized lookup tables” that can be used to reverse-engineer one-way hash functions. A rainbow table is basically a pre-computed set of plaintext strings and their corresponding hashes.\n  *  Large rainbow tables are publicly available, and attackers can use one of these tables to retrieve cleartext data that has been hashed.\n"

Then, this trade will increase the price of asset B (increased demand) and reduce the cost of asset A (increased supply).\n    - Pump and Dump: \n      * In this, an attacker takes a flash loan from one platform to split the loan between the other two lending platforms to pump the price of an asset in one and dump the price of an asset in another before returning the loan to the first lending platform in a single transaction.\n  - (Risk-free) Arbitrage using flash loans.\n  - Wash-trading:\n    * In this, the borrower takes out a flash loan of Y tokens on DEX A, then execute two trades by swapping Y tokens for Z tokens on DEX B and vice-versa again on DEX B. This increases the trading volume for the Y tokens, creating an artificial level of interest and opportunity for profit. \n  - Flash Minting:\n    * In this, attackers can mint an arbitrary number of new Flash-mintable tokens (a.k.a FMTs or ERC20-compliant tokens) into their account, as long as they also burn the same number of tokens from their account before the end of the same transaction to generate profits.\n  - Collateral swapping:\n    * It enables DeFi users to swap or switch the collateral asset that they used to take out a flash loan on a lending app. \n- Flash Loan Based Liquidation works:\n  * When a liquidator does not have the cryptocurrency upfront to repay and has to complete liquidation in one transaction.\n"

They invented this technique for efficient time-stamping of digital documents.\n  * Adam Back in 2002 invents the idea of Proof of Work idea.\n  * Proof of Work was based on the paper work by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor (1992) that was aimed at eliminating junk mail.\n  * The sender needs to do some computational task before sending the mail. This was easy to do when done once but becomes infeasible to do for millions of recipients.\n  * Moreover, Blockchain is not Bitcoin rather Bitcoin employs the technology of Blockchain.  \n"

This ledger is quickly and easily accessbile by anyone and further shared by many which explains its distributive nature.\n  * These ledgers are responsible for process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.\n  * These are responsible for storing data and assets such as tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).\n  * Blockchain ledger is distributed. All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions.\n  * Due to this distributed mechanism the transactions are recorded only for once, eliminating the duplication of data something which is very frequent in traditional business mechanisms.\n  * Tampering or changing these transactions in the ledger is impossible for a particiapnt to do so.\n  * Thus, these records ensure proper immutability.\n\n- Blockchain Transactions and Blocks\n  * Whenever a transaction occurs it is stored as a \"block\" of data.\n  * These transactions show the movement of assets tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual).\n  * These data blocks store a variety of information such as who, what, when, where and also conditions such as temperature.\n  * Each block is connected to one before and after it. The blocks represent the flow of ownership of some data.\n  * Each of these blocks have a hashed reference to the block before it so you can trace every transaction all the way back to genesis block.\n  * These block are securely linked to each other to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.\n  * Blockchain hashes are highly secure. They strengthen the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain.\n"

Thus hashing creates great deal of security. \n\n- The Bad Effects\n  * Attackers who have fast hardware can easily \"crack\" hash values to original text.\n  * Good hash alogrithms are made to be collission resistant. But it is impossible to eliminate collissions completely. Algorithms like MD5 , SHA-1 are known to contain collsions-produce same hash value for two different input credentials.\n  * Rainbow tables are “optimized lookup tables” that can be used to reverse-engineer one-way hash functions. A rainbow table is basically a pre-computed set of plaintext strings and their corresponding hashes.\n  *  Large rainbow tables are publicly available, and attackers can use one of these tables to retrieve cleartext data that has been hashed.\n"

They invented this technique for efficient time-stamping of digital documents.\n  * Adam Back in 2002 invents the idea of Proof of Work idea.\n  * Proof of Work was based on the paper work by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor (1992) that was aimed at eliminating junk mail.\n  * The sender needs to do some computational task before sending the mail. This was easy to do when done once but becomes infeasible to do for millions of recipients.\n  * Moreover, Blockchain is not Bitcoin rather Bitcoin employs the technology of Blockchain.  \n"

This ledger is quickly and easily accessbile by anyone and further shared by many which explains its distributive nature.\n  * These ledgers are responsible for process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.\n  * These are responsible for storing data and assets such as tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).\n  * Blockchain ledger is distributed. All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions.\n  * Due to this distributed mechanism the transactions are recorded only for once, eliminating the duplication of data something which is very frequent in traditional business mechanisms.\n  * Tampering or changing these transactions in the ledger is impossible for a particiapnt to do so.\n  * Thus, these records ensure proper immutability.\n\n- Blockchain Transactions and Blocks\n  * Whenever a transaction occurs it is stored as a \"block\" of data.\n  * These transactions show the movement of assets tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual).\n  * These data blocks store a variety of information such as who, what, when, where and also conditions such as temperature.\n  * Each block is connected to one before and after it. The blocks represent the flow of ownership of some data.\n  * Each of these blocks have a hashed reference to the block before it so you can trace every transaction all the way back to genesis block.\n  * These block are securely linked to each other to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.\n  * Blockchain hashes are highly secure. They strengthen the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain.\n"

Thus hashing creates great deal of security. \n\n- The Bad Effects\n  * Attackers who have fast hardware can easily \"crack\" hash values to original text.\n  * Good hash alogrithms are made to be collission resistant. But it is impossible to eliminate collissions completely. Algorithms like MD5 , SHA-1 are known to contain collsions-produce same hash value for two different input credentials.\n  * Rainbow tables are “optimized lookup tables” that can be used to reverse-engineer one-way hash functions. A rainbow table is basically a pre-computed set of plaintext strings and their corresponding hashes.\n  *  Large rainbow tables are publicly available, and attackers can use one of these tables to retrieve cleartext data that has been hashed.\n"

They invented this technique for efficient time-stamping of digital documents.\n  * Adam Back in 2002 invents the idea of Proof of Work idea.\n  * Proof of Work was based on the paper work by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor (1992) that was aimed at eliminating junk mail.\n  * The sender needs to do some computational task before sending the mail. This was easy to do when done once but becomes infeasible to do for millions of recipients.\n  * Moreover, Blockchain is not Bitcoin rather Bitcoin employs the technology of Blockchain.  \n"

          "details": "- Blockchain ledger\n  * The ledger which is present in blockchain is more than a simple ledger. This ledger is quickly and easily accessbile by anyone and further shared by many which explains its distributive nature.\n  * These ledgers are responsible for process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.\n  * These are responsible for storing data and assets such as tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).\n  * Blockchain ledger is distributed. All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions.\n  * Due to this distributed mechanism the transactions are recorded only for once, eliminating the duplication of data something which is very frequent in traditional business mechanisms.\n  * Tampering or changing these transactions in the ledger is impossible for a particiapnt to do so.\n  * Thus, these records ensure proper immutability.\n\n- Blockchain Transactions and Blocks\n  * Whenever a transaction occurs it is stored as a \"block\" of data.\n  * These transactions show the movement of assets tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual).\n  * These data blocks store a variety of information such as who, what, when, where and also conditions such as temperature.\n  * Each block is connected to one before and after it. The blocks represent the flow of ownership of some data.\n  * Each of these blocks have a hashed reference to the block before it so you can trace every transaction all the way back to genesis block.\n  * These block are securely linked to each other to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.\n  * Blockchain hashes are highly secure. They strengthen the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain.\n"

Thus hashing creates great deal of security. \n\n- The Bad Effects\n  * Attackers who have fast hardware can easily \"crack\" hash values to original text.\n  * Good hash alogrithms are made to be collission resistant. But it is impossible to eliminate collissions completely. Algorithms like MD5 , SHA-1 are known to contain collsions-produce same hash value for two different input credentials.\n  * Rainbow tables are “optimized lookup tables” that can be used to reverse-engineer one-way hash functions. A rainbow table is basically a pre-computed set of plaintext strings and their corresponding hashes.\n  *  Large rainbow tables are publicly available, and attackers can use one of these tables to retrieve cleartext data that has been hashed.\n"

They invented this technique for efficient time-stamping of digital documents.\n  * Adam Back in 2002 invents the idea of Proof of Work idea.\n  * Proof of Work was based on the paper work by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor (1992) that was aimed at eliminating junk mail.\n  * The sender needs to do some computational task before sending the mail. This was easy to do when done once but becomes infeasible to do for millions of recipients.\n  * Moreover, Blockchain is not Bitcoin rather Bitcoin employs the technology of Blockchain.  \n"

This ledger is quickly and easily accessbile by anyone and further shared by many which explains its distributive nature.\n  * These ledgers are responsible for process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.\n  * These are responsible for storing data and assets such as tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).\n  * Blockchain ledger is distributed. All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions.\n  * Due to this distributed mechanism the transactions are recorded only for once, eliminating the duplication of data something which is very frequent in traditional business mechanisms.\n  * Tampering or changing these transactions in the ledger is impossible for a particiapnt to do so.\n  * Thus, these records ensure proper immutability.\n\n- Blockchain Transactions and Blocks\n  * Whenever a transaction occurs it is stored as a \"block\" of data.\n  * These transactions show the movement of assets tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual).\n  * These data blocks store a variety of information such as who, what, when, where and also conditions such as temperature.\n  * Each block is connected to one before and after it. The blocks represent the flow of ownership of some data.\n  * Each of these blocks have a hashed reference to the block before it so you can trace every transaction all the way back to genesis block.\n  * These block are securely linked to each other to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.\n  * Blockchain hashes are highly secure. They strengthen the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain.\n"

Thus hashing creates great deal of security. \n\n- The Bad Effects\n  * Attackers who have fast hardware can easily \"crack\" hash values to original text.\n  * Good hash alogrithms are made to be collission resistant. But it is impossible to eliminate collissions completely. Algorithms like MD5 , SHA-1 are known to contain collsions-produce same hash value for two different input credentials.\n  * Rainbow tables are “optimized lookup tables” that can be used to reverse-engineer one-way hash functions. A rainbow table is basically a pre-computed set of plaintext strings and their corresponding hashes.\n  *  Large rainbow tables are publicly available, and attackers can use one of these tables to retrieve cleartext data that has been hashed.\n"

They invented this technique for efficient time-stamping of digital documents.\n  * Adam Back in 2002 invents the idea of Proof of Work idea.\n  * Proof of Work was based on the paper work by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor (1992) that was aimed at eliminating junk mail.\n  * The sender needs to do some computational task before sending the mail. This was easy to do when done once but becomes infeasible to do for millions of recipients.\n  * Moreover, Blockchain is not Bitcoin rather Bitcoin employs the technology of Blockchain.  \n"

This ledger is quickly and easily accessbile by anyone and further shared by many which explains its distributive nature.\n  * These ledgers are responsible for process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.\n  * These are responsible for storing data and assets such as tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).\n  * Blockchain ledger is distributed. All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions.\n  * Due to this distributed mechanism the transactions are recorded only for once, eliminating the duplication of data something which is very frequent in traditional business mechanisms.\n  * Tampering or changing these transactions in the ledger is impossible for a particiapnt to do so.\n  * Thus, these records ensure proper immutability.\n\n- Blockchain Transactions and Blocks\n  * Whenever a transaction occurs it is stored as a \"block\" of data.\n  * These transactions show the movement of assets tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual).\n  * These data blocks store a variety of information such as who, what, when, where and also conditions such as temperature.\n  * Each block is connected to one before and after it. The blocks represent the flow of ownership of some data.\n  * Each of these blocks have a hashed reference to the block before it so you can trace every transaction all the way back to genesis block.\n  * These block are securely linked to each other to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.\n  * Blockchain hashes are highly secure. They strengthen the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain.\n"

Thus hashing creates great deal of security. \n\n- The Bad Effects\n  * Attackers who have fast hardware can easily \"crack\" hash values to original text.\n  * Good hash alogrithms are made to be collission resistant. But it is impossible to eliminate collissions completely. Algorithms like MD5 , SHA-1 are known to contain collsions-produce same hash value for two different input credentials.\n  * Rainbow tables are “optimized lookup tables” that can be used to reverse-engineer one-way hash functions. A rainbow table is basically a pre-computed set of plaintext strings and their corresponding hashes.\n  *  Large rainbow tables are publicly available, and attackers can use one of these tables to retrieve cleartext data that has been hashed.\n"
