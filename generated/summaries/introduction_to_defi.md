 ## What is DeFi and Use Cases
 
 **Introduction to Decentralised Finance**        
- DeFi Origin
  * DeFi is an open and global financial system built for the rise of next revolution in the internet space.
  * It provides you control, visibility and complete access towards your funds.
  * DeFi provides opportunities to anyone with an internet connection to access financial services.
  * It is largely owned and maintained by its users.

- What is DeFi?
  * DeFi is a collective term for financial products and services that are accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
  * With DeFi, the markets are always open and there are no centralized authorities who can block payments or deny you access to anything.
  * Services that were previously slow and at risk of human error are automatic and safer now that they're handled by code that anyone can inspect and scrutinize.
 
 **Centralised vs Decentralised Finance**        
Centralised Finance consist of many problems. Some of them are as listed below.

- Centralized Control
  * Centralised banking system is highly concentrated.
  * National central banks controls currency
  * Big Tech giants like Amazon, Facebook, Goolge provide non-financial centralization in the system.

- Limited Access
  * Around the globe there are more than 1.7 billion individuals who are unbanked.
  * Billions of people are underbanked
  * Many Entrepreneurs use credit cards to to finance their business, but banks won't lend them because they are small. This puts a negative impact on growth.

- Inefficiency
  * Banks charge 3% for a credit card swipe
  * 5-7% is charged for a wire transfer
  * It takes 2 days to settle a stock transaction
  * Fund transfer is slow
  * Banks are prone to fauds, chargebanks and lack security as well.
  * Banks do not allow micro-transitions.
  * It is difficult to get paid using banks.

- Lack of Interoperability
  * Institutions are isolated from each other and have no interlinking.
  * It is difficult to move funds from one bank to another.
  * Difficult to move money from a bank to non bank.
  
- Opacity
  * Banking institutions have very little transparency.
  * Bank customers do not know the health of the bank.
  * Individuals are forced to rely on costly regulation and promise of bailouts.

These problems when not tackled lead to following destructive effects.

- Missed Growth Opportunities
  * Entrepreneurs who have suppose 25% ROI on their great idea, but their project is not executed due to high cost of credit card borrowing.
  * High ROI project fuels high CAPEX, strong real GDP growth, and robust employment growth.

- Inequality of opportunities
  * Projects should be financed based on the quality of the idea and the soundness of the execution plan.
  * Many have no access to internet commerce (to buy or sell).
  * Given the number of unbanked and underbanked, this creates unequal opportunities and perpetuates or even exacerbates inequality.
 
 **Decentralised Finance Usage**        
Centralised Finance opens up a wide range of advancement in the current centralised system.

- Transfer for Money 
  * Using DeFi sending money would be as easy as sending an email.
  * You just need to enter other persons account address and your payment will directly go into their account.

- Stream money around the globe
  * One can stream money over ethereum
  * This lets you pay someone their salary by the second, giving them access to their money whenever they need it. Or rent something by the second like a storage locker or electric scooter.

- Access to stablecoins
  * Volatility in the cryptocurrency is of huge concern which hinders its growth as well.
  * DeFi community has introduced stablecoins.
  * Their value remains peggged to another asset, usually a popular currency like dollar.
  * Coins like Dai or USDC have a value that stays within a few cents of a dollar.

- Borrowing 
  * DeFi helps in borrowing money with privacy. 
  * The borrower must put up collateral that the lender will automatically receive if their loan is not repaid. 
  * This allows you to borrow money without credit checks or handing over private information.

- Flash loans
  * DeFi introduced the concept of flash loans where the borrower gets loans without handling any collateral to lender.
  * If the borrower is not able to pay the loan, the transaction is reversed as if it never occured.

- Tokenization
  * DeFi intriduces the concepts of crypto tokens.
  * Ethereum enables robust smart contract capabilities, thereby opening up the roads for issuing crypto tokens. 
  * Crypto tokens basically worked as digital assets present on a blockchain alongside having different features and uses.
