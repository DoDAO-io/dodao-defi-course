 ## Tokenization
 
 **Consensus layer**        
Blockchain is an public append-only data which allows persistence,consensus, liveness and is open   
- Persistence: once added, data can never be removed*
- Consensus: all honest participants have the same data**
- Liveness: honest participants can add new transactions
- Open(?): anyone can add data
 
 **Cryptographic Primitives**        
Cryptographic Primitives.....   
- Collision resistant hashing: commit to data on a blockchain 
   ‚üπ Merkle trees: commit to a list; later open one cell
- "Digital signatures: authorizing actions"
- "SNARK proofs: prove that a certain statement is true
   1. short proof
   2. fast verification"
 
 **Scaling the blockchain**        
Ethereum L1 has a limit on number of transactions it can process   
- Scaling the blockchain: Payment channels and Rollups (L2 scaling)
