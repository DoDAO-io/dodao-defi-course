    - How Ethereum Transaction work?
      * Transactions involve sending data and/or ETH (or other tokens)
      from one address to another.
      * An Ethereum user can control addresses through an externally
      owned account (EOA) or by using smart contract code (contract
      account).
      * When sending data to a contract account, the data are used to
      execute code in that contract.
      * Transactions sent to an EOA can only transfer ETH.
      * A single transaction starts with an end user from an EOA, but it can pass through many dApps (decentralised Applications) before completing.
      * Transaction begins with a single smart contract and continues to carry on all the intermediate steps within the contract body.
    
    - Atomicity
      * This is one of the most important property of Ethereum Transaction Mechanism which makes DeFi different from CeFi.
      * The transactions in Ethereum are atomic which means the clauses in a smart contract can lead to failure of transaction and thus all the steps of the transaction are reversed.
      * Atomicity is a critical feature of transactions because funds can
      move between many contracts (i.e., “exchange hands”) with the
      knowledge and security that if one of the conditions is not met,
      the contract terms reset as if the money never left the starting
      point.

    - Mempool
      * Transactions are posted to a memory pool, or mempool, before
      they are added to a block. 
      * Miners monitor these posted transactions, add them to their own
      mempool, and share the transaction with other miners to be
      included in the next available block.
    
    - Miner Extractable Value
      * Any actor can see transactions in the mempool by running or
      communicating with mining nodes.
      * This observation allows for front-running (legal in the DeFi space) to miners. If miner encounters a large order, they can plave their order before that, hence the miners are incentivised to do so.
      * Miner extractable value (MEV) is a measure of the profit that the
      miner could make by including, excluding or re-ordering
      transactions. 
      * This is one of the drawback of the Proof of work consensus mechanism. Obfuscating transactions can mitigate MEV, thus hiding from miners how they might profit from transactions.

  shortTitle: Ethereum Components

    - Smart Contracts
      * Ethereum is the example of most popular smart contract platform.
      * A smart contract is code that can create and transform arbitrary data or
      tokens on top of the blockchain of which it is a part.
      * These are extremely powerful because it allows users to trustlessly encode
      rules for any type of transaction and even create scarce assets with
      specialized functionality.
      * Many standard business contracts can be algorithmically encoded and
      algorithmically enforced. These contracts run on the Ethereum blockchain and are run on every node.
      * This is not just useful for finance. For example, supply chains are another
      good example.

    - Gas 
      * Transactions have a gas fee that is the fee received by the miners for conducting transactions.
      * Transactions have a gas fee, which varies based on the complexity
      of the transaction. E.g., low gas fee is used to compensate a miner
      for including and executing a transaction, and high gas fee for
      more data-intensive transactions.
      * If a transaction reverts due to any failure or runs out of gas the
      miner forfeits all gas used until that point. This helps miners earn even if large volumes of failed transactions occur.

      - Gas fees
        * The gas price is determined by the market and effectively creates
        an auction for inclusion in the next Ethereum block.
        * Higher gas fees signal higher demand and therefore generally
        receive higher priority for inclusion.
      
      - Gas Price 
        * Every operation on the Ethereum blockchain requires gas.
        * Each unit of gas has a gas price, which is denoted in gwei. 1 gwei = 1
          billionth of an ETH. Gas prices increase as users outbid one another
          during times of higher network congestion.
      
      - Gas Limit
        * The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas a user is willing to use for a
        transaction. A transaction can include multiple operations.
        * If there is residual amount of gas after the transaction is complete, then the user gets back the remaining gas.

      - Turing Complete
        * Gas plays a very important role. If a malicious attack is planned then it would be extremely expensive to carry out.
        * Ethereum is turing complete whereas Bitcoin is not.

    - Oracles
      * Ethereum blockchain nows only of what happens inside the Blockchain. But how does it get the information needed from the outside world? Here Oracles come into play.
      * An oracle, in the context of smart contract platforms, is any data source for reporting information external to the blockchain. 

      - Oracle Problem
        * This refers to the correctness of the off-chain information that is provided by the oracle.
        * One Ethereum-based platform known as Chainlink is designed to solve the
        oracle problem by using an aggregation of data sources. The Chainlink
        whitepaper includes a reputation-based system that is decentralized.
