    - What is Lending(also known as “financing”)?
      * Lending occurs when someone(here lender) allows another person to borrow something (such as Money, property, or another asset) with the expectation that the borrower will either return the asset or repay the lender with some interest.
      * We all are currently learning DeFi, so let’s see On-Chain Lending and Borrowing(i.e Credit):-      
      - Entities of Lending and Borrowing:-
        * Lender: Deposit Principal in the Liquidity Pool(or Vault) and gets back Principal with interest.
        * Borrower: Collateralize Assets and get the back borrowed amount
        * Liquidator: Liquidates the Liquidity pool
        * Price Oracle: Report prices or send exact prices of assets from different sources(either centralized or decentralized) to the Protocol.

    - Collateral: 
      * An asset that serves as a security deposit on the debt taken.

    - Over-collateralization:
      * When the value of collateral assets exceeds the value of the granted loan then it is called an Over-collateralized loan. 

    - Under-collateralization:
      * When the value of collateral assets is below the value of the granted loan then it is called an Under-collateralized loan.

    - Liquidation: 
      * Selling collateral assets of a borrower is called Liquidation.
      
    - Health Factor (In detail):
      * Health Factor = Borrowing Capacity / Total Value of Debts
      * Borrowing is the summation of all the values of the collateral we have, times a `liquidation threshold`
        0 < liquidation threshold < 1 (Range)
      * The liquidation threshold provides a “secure” margin
      * When the health factor declines below 1, a borrowing position becomes liquidatable

- title: Collateralization
  shortTitle: collateralization
  key: collateralization
  details: |
    - Collateralization:
      * It is the process of securing a loan with a valuable asset(a.k.a Collateral) by the loan borrower. There are two types of Collateraliztion:-

      - Over-collateralization:
        - In this, the borrower has to provide:
          * value(collateral assets) > value(debt or granted loan) 
          * It means they allow to borrow less than the collateralize amount
          * But allows the borrower to freely use their funds which they get as a loan
        - Let's say a borrower collateralizes ETH and borrows DAI
          * The value of ETH (collateral) exceeds the value of DAI (debt)
          * Now, the borrower can use the borrowed DAI arbitrarily/freely

      - Under-collateralization:
        - In this, the borrower has to provide
          * value(collateral assests) < value(debt or granted loan)
          * It means they allow to borrow more than the collateralize amount
          * But they highly restrict the borrower to use their funds as they don’t get their borrowed funds immediately as smart contracts manage how a borrower can use money
        - Let's say a borrower collateralizes ETH and borrows DAI
          * The value of DAI (debt) can exceed the value of ETH (collateral)
          * The collateralized ETH and borrowed DAI are restricted to be used with pre-designed smart contracts. Those are typically farming contracts.
          * The vault remains in control of all assets.

- title: Liquidation
  shortTitle: liquidation
  key: liquidation
  details: |
    -Liquidation:
      * Liquidation == Selling collateral from the borrower
      * Liquidators/Anyone can liquidate the collateralized asset in return for an incentive (in the form of an opportunity to purchase the collateralize asset at a lower value than the market)
        * If value(collateral assets) <= 150% * value(debt or granted loan)   (...for example)
      * There may also be auctions for liquidating the collateralized asset whose value degraded.
      - Liquidation Insights:
        - Health Factor:
          * A Fixed Spread liquidation does not necessarily increase the health factor
        - Close Factor (CF): 
          * The maximum proportion of the debt that is allowed to be repaid in a fixed spread liquidation
          * Value of Debt to Repay < ( Close Factor * Total Value of Debt )
        - Over-liquidation:
          * Liquidations sell excessive amounts of borrower’s collateral
        - Optimal Liquidation Strategy:
          * Liquidating up to the close factor is not necessarily the best strategy.
          * Instead, two successive liquidations might offer more profits.
        - Data suggests:
          * Auction liquidations might be more borrower-friendly

- title: Liquidation Spread (LS)
  shortTitle: liquidation spread
  key: liquidation-spread
  details: |
    - Liquidation Spread (LS):
      * It is the spread/range of bonus, or discount, that a liquidator can collect when liquidating collateral.
      * Value of Collateral to Claim = Value of Debt to Repay * (1 + LS)
      * Two types of Liquidation based on Liquidation Spread:-
      - Fixed Spread:
        * In this, the Liquidator does both settlements in one Blockchain transaction such as:
          * Repays the debt of a borrowing position to Vault
          * And Acquires the collateral at a discounted price from the position in return. 
            * Eg. Typical discounts can lie between 5-15% in the case of Aave.
      - Variable (or Auction Based) Spread:
        * In this, various liquidators bid over time until the auction terminates and this process requires multiple blockchain transactions.
        * Types of Auction Liquidation:
          - English Auction:
            * In this, Bidders outbid each other increasingly
          - Dutch Auction:
            * This, Auction begins with a high asking price and the price lowers until the auction terminates 
            * Eg, MakerDAO Dutch Auction:-
              - Instant Settlement:
                * Unlike the English auction which is operated in multiple transactions, the MAkerDAO Dutch auction is settled instantly in one atomic transaction.
              - Flash Lending of Collateral:
                * No upfront DAI (i.e, the debt or granted loan) is required (i.e., a flash loan used specifically for MakerDAO liquidations).
              - Price as a Function of Time:
                * Collateral price decreases over time and nobody can get the collateral for free by accident.

- title: Flash Loans
  shortTitle: Flash Loans
  key: flash-loans
  details: |
    - Definition:
      * Take loans(in a flash)—> Use them—> Repay loan + interest all in one single atomic blockchain transaction(eg, It takes 12-14 sec in the case of Ethereum Blockchain).
    - Flash Loan Use Cases:
      * DeFi attacks
      * Price Oracle Manipulation
      * Pump and Dump
      * (Risk-free) Arbitrage
      * Wash-trading
      * Flash Minting
      * Collateral swapping
    - Flash Loan Based Liquidation works:
      * When a liquidator does not have the cryptocurrency upfront to repay and has to complete liquidation in one transaction.

  details: |
    - Over-colleteralized borrowing seems to be not relevant initially as the amount of collateral needed to borrow the 
      tokens can be quite high. But thee are many user cases for it.
      * **Yield Farming** - The process involves leveraging DeFi protocols to lend cryptocurrencies for high returns that can 
        go up to 100% in annualized yields. Yield farming originates from banks’ process in lending your deposits; the difference 
        is that DeFi yield farming compounds the interest earned.
      * **Arbitrage** - Arbitrage takes advantage of the fact that an asset may be worth more in one market than another. While 
        this usually happens because of market inefficiencies, it can also be used to exploit differences in rates between 
        different platforms.
      * **Margin Trading (Leverage)** - Taking out a loan with extra collateral can help you gain leverage, and you can repeat 
        the process until you reach the limit.
      * **Liquidation** - Liquidations can be quite profitable, especially for tech-savvy traders. Usually, a liquidator has to 
        compete against other people for the same job, so he uses bots. They work by "sniping" the loans that are under the 
        collateralization ratio. This way, they can liquidate the collateral and reimburse the lender. In turn, the liquidator 
        receives a reward fee for his services.
      * **Risk-reduction/Hedging** - No matter how well you think you know the markets, there will always be bumps in the road. As 
        a trader, you need to find ways to protect your investment from risk, and this is where crypto hedging strategies come in. 
        Hedging encompasses opening positions in opposing market directions to reduce the risks and impacts of market swings. By doing this, 
        you can help to offset any potential losses that might occur.
