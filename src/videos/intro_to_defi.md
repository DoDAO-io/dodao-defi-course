# Video 1 - Problems with Trad Finance and DeFi Into
What will user learn

Traditional Finance Disadvantages
- Inefficiency - Time of transaction, spending on offices and buildings
- Non Innovation
- Opaque - You don't know how your funds are used
- Hidden Fees

DeFi Solves This
- DeFi includes no human interaction so its very efficient
- Anyone can write DeFi programs and we see new innovative DeFi innovative products coming up everyday. When is the last time you hard about truly revolutionary product in TradFi 
- Code is Open Source, so its transparent and you can see what is going inside
- Since the code is available to everyone, there are no hidden fees

Some things to keep in mind
- No all cryto platforms are Decentralized
- There are many centralized platform that promise 10-100x gains, but provide no transparency
- Be careful of these projects as they are opaque and not regulated, which can lead to losses of money

# Video 2 - DeFi Into 
- Blockchain enables tokenization of assets and transferring them from one person to another i.e. you can easily transfer moeny or someother asset to anyone in the world within few seconds
- In blockchain we can have two types of accounts, accounts for users, and accounts for smart contracts. In banks it is not passible to create an account for a software or a program
- Allowing creating account for smart contracts or programs, allows us to innovate and come up with new products
- Some of new products that are there in DeFi are
  - DEX - AMM
  - Lending and Borrowing all handles by smart contracts
  - ...


# Video 3 - Use Cases of DeFi 
- Transfer of Money
  * Using DeFi sending money would be as easy as sending an email.
  * You just need to enter other persons account address and your payment will directly go into their account.

- Stream money around the globe
  * One can stream money over ethereum
  * This lets you pay someone their salary by the second, giving them access to their money whenever they need it. Or rent something by the second like a storage locker or electric scooter.

- Access to stablecoins
  * Volatility in the cryptocurrency is of huge concern which hinders its growth as well.
  * DeFi community has introduced stablecoins.
  * Their value remains peggged to another asset, usually a popular currency like dollar.
  * Coins like Dai or USDC have a value that stays within a few cents of a dollar.

- Borrowing
  * DeFi helps in borrowing money with privacy.
  * The borrower must put up collateral that the lender will automatically receive if their loan is not repaid.
  * This allows you to borrow money without credit checks or handing over private information.

- Flash loans
  * DeFi introduced the concept of flash loans where the borrower gets loans without handling any collateral to lender.
  * If the borrower is not able to pay the loan, the transaction is reversed as if it never occured.

- Tokenization
  * DeFi introduces the concepts of crypto tokens.
  * Ethereum enables robust smart contract capabilities, thereby opening up the roads for issuing crypto tokens.
  * Crypto tokens basically worked as digital assets present on a blockchain alongside having different features and uses.

- Constant Updation
  * Developers can build upon existing code because DeFi is open source.
  * Easy to build applications/products (Cloud simplified creation of applications. Blockchain simplifies creation of financial apps)
  * This helps in removing bugs and bring about great innovations in the existing system.
