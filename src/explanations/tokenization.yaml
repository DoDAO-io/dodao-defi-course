    Traditional finance models and tools have worked well until the last few
    years, but they leave a lot to be desired when it comes to offering
    compensation for new ways of collaboration or providing access to a global
    financial system for everyone. Let's take a look at some of the areas where
    traditional finance falls short:


    ### Compensation

    With the traditional ways of compensating employees through salaries or
    stocks, many organizations are now finding it difficult to keep up with the
    changing demands of the workforce. With more people working remotely and for
    fewer hours each week, the rigid financial structures of traditional
    companies are no longer able to keep up. However, in the world of
    cryptocurrency, one can simply write a few lines of code to create and
    distribute tokens based on whatever rules they want. This flexibility has
    already led to some incredible changes in the way we compensate team
    members. Compensation by traditional finance fails in the following
    scenarios

    1) **Global Projects/Companies** - With the rise of globalization, we now
    have teams of individuals who work together across timezones and may never
    meet or talk to one another in person. In many cases, these types of remote
    communities or projects are the most effective ones. For these projects,
    local compensation rules are outdated and they want new and flexible ways of
    compensating the project members.

    2) **Open Source Projects** - Open source projects can reach a great level
    of success, but the people who put work into them often don't reap any
    benefits when the project does well. The reason is that it's tricky to come
    up with a standard business model for open source projects. If you're
    thinking of contributing to an open source project, it's crucial to think
    about how you can monetize it. Financially stable projects can allow team
    members to work on things they're passionate about full time with
    like-minded people - which sounds amazing, right?

    3) **Flexible Roles and Responsibilities** - With organizations' outcomes in
    terms of revenue and profits becoming more unpredictable than ever, it's
    important that compensation models and software can adapt to assign equity
    to all contributors in a flexible way based on the work they actually
    perform. This allows for a more accurate division of rewards and motivates
    people to continue putting in their best effort even when things are tough.


    ### Global Financial System

    Developed countries offer residents more reliable financial opportunities
    than many other parts of the world. For example, people in developing
    countries may not have access to reliable investing tools that can protect
    their money from things like hyper inflation. Traditional Finance doesn't
    provide the following investment tools to everyone globally

    1) **Stock Investing** - When it comes to investing, some of the most stable
    companies to put your money into are ones like Google, Apple, Amazon, and
    Tesla. Even with Tesla's stock prices rising by over 10,000%, many people
    have held onto their shares - but not everyone has that opportunity. There
    are plenty of people globally who don't have access to these modern growth
    stocks.

    2) **Vesture Investing** - Venture investing opportunities have been mostly
    limited to people with a net worth of a million dollars or earning upwards
    of $200,000 per year. Traditional investing offers no opportunity for small
    retail investors to get in on the action. Public companies have mostly gone
    through their exponential growth lifecycle, so retail investors get access
    to opportunities that have normalized growth.

    3) **Commodity investing** - investing in commodities like gold, silver, and
    copper - should be available to everyone. However, many countries lack the
    financial infrastructure needed for citizens to invest in these commodities.
    In addition, inflation rates in some countries can be as high as 200%, which
    reduces the purchasing power of citizens by half each year.


    ### Business to Business Partnerships

    B2B partnerships can be very complex, involving legal contracts that can
    take months to finalize. Even the simplest contract can cost a business
    upwards of $10,000. This can make it very difficult for small businesses to
    collaborate and work towards common goals.


    In the crypto world, however, you often see projects arranging token swaps.
    This creates a common financial interest for both parties, making it much
    easier to work together.


    ### Lack of Liquidity

    Lack of liquidity is a significant challenge for retail investors when it
    comes to investing in items such as real estate or small businesses.
    However, tokenization helps to overcome this by fractionalizing ownership
    and providing innovative ways to create liquidity. Some participants of the
    industry estimate that tokenization could lead to unlocking trillions of
    euros that are currently in illiquid assets, which would vastly increase the
    volumes of trade.

    A Token can be thought of as a representation of value that can be exchanged
    or traded in most cases.


    There are many different types of tokens:

    1) **Coins/AltCoins** - These are native to blockchain and can be used for
    payments or to power transactions. The most 
       famous type of coins are Bitcoin(BTC) and Ethereum(ETH). These are normally awarded to the validators of the 
       transaction, but can also be bought and exchanged.
    2) **Security tokens** -  are digital assets that represent some type of
    underlying asset, equity, or commodity. There are many different types of
    security tokens, including:

       1) **Stocks or Bonds** - These tokens represent an underlying stock or bond. They help investors from any country gain exposure to one of the most famous stocks or bonds.

       2) **Commodities** - These tokens represent a commodity, such as gold or oil. They help investors from any country gain exposure to the commodity market.

       3) **Real Estate** - These tokens represent a piece of property. They help investors from any country gain exposure to the real estate market.
    3) **Protocol/product tokens** - these tokens are issued by a protocol and
    may or may not have any utility or governance power related to them.
    Examples of these tokens include MKR, AAVE and COMP. 

    4) **Utility Tokens** - they can serve any purpose that a developer wants
    them to. In general, utility tokens provide access to a specific service or
    product within a blockchain ecosystem. They can often be the same as the
    protocol token or can be different. 

    5) **Governance Tokens** - Governance tokens are primarily used for voting
    and decision-making within a protocol or organization. They may also offer
    some financial incentives, but their main purpose is to give token holders a
    say in how the protocol or organization is run.

    6) **Cause-Based Tokens** - they are designed to support a specific cause or
    charity. They typically don't offer any financial incentives or utility, but
    are meant to show support for the cause they represent. 

    7) **NFTs** - NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a type of cryptocurrency
    that is limited in supply and has a unique identity. NFTs are difficult to
    copy or replicate, making them ideal for representing digital or real-world
    assets such as paintings, photographs, or other materials.


    For asset or equity-backed tokens, there is usually a custodian and an
    investment institution involved in the process of creating a tokenized
    stock, assets or commodities. The institution buys the underlying stock and
    deposits it with the custodian. Based on the number of shares that the
    custodian holds in reserve, tokens are issued on a blockchain. The price of
    each token is pegged to the value of the shares.This process allows for a
    more efficient way of buying and selling stocks or assets, as well as a more
    secure way of storing them. By using a blockchain, there is no need for a
    third party to keep track of ownership or transactions. This makes the
    process more transparent and less susceptible to fraud.


    In 2022, many cryptocurrency exchanges went bankrupt because the tokens they
    were holding were not kept isolated. These exchanges were centralized
    entities that were built on top of decentralized technology, and they didn't
    disclose whether or not users' funds were backed 1:1 at all times. As an
    educated blockchain user, we should be aware whenever we are depositing
    custody of our assets or tokens to anyone else.

    ### Inflation


    ### Deflation


    ### Bonding Curve

    A bonding curve is a type of pricing mechanism that is commonly used in the
    world of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi). It is a
    mathematical formula that describes the relationship between the supply and
    demand of a particular token, and determines the price at which that token
    can be bought or sold.


    Some benefits of bonding curves in the world of cryptocurrency and
    decentralized finance (DeFi) include:

    1) They provide a transparent and predictable mechanism for determining the
    price of a token, which can help to promote fair and efficient markets.

    2) They can be used to incentivize certain behaviours or reward certain
    contributions to the network, which can help to align the interests of
    different users and promote the long-term growth and success of the project.

    3) They can enable the creation of new financial instruments and investment
    opportunities that were previously difficult or impossible to manage.

    Some benefits of tokenization include:


    ### Innovation for Today's Needs

    1) **Compensation** - Tokens offer a more flexible way of compensating team
    members than was previously available. For example, you can compensate team
    members in tokens based on the amount of their contribution and the
    criticality of their work. This allows the project to focus on developing
    the business rather than on fundraising. Also, everyone who receives tokens
    is now a shareholder and is aligned with the same goals.


    2) **Rewards** - Tokenization provides a more innovative way to compensate
    members or users who believe in a project's long-term success by distribute
    tokens based on bonding curves. This system would favour early adopters.
    Another example of this could be seen with Vote Escrowed Tokenomics where
    members who have locked their tokens away can earn boosted rewards because
    they believe in the project's longevity.


    3) **User Acquisition** - Startups typically spend a lot of money on
    marketing to acquire new customers through big advertizing companies like
    Google, Apple, Facebook, etc. However, this doesn't provide much help to the
    founders or to the end users. A better form of customer acquisition is
    through air drops. Air drops are one of the most innovative ways of
    acquiring new users as they reward the end user and also reduce the cost and
    the risk to the startup, as they are paying the acquired users in the form
    of tokens. This method is more beneficial to everyone involved - the
    founders, the end users, and even the startup itself!


    ### More power to Retail Investor

    1) **More Opportunities for Investors** - Fractional ownership of assets
    provides many benefits to investors, including the ability to hold claims
    that are smaller than what is typically seen in stocks and bonds. This type
    of ownership also allows for the tokenization of assets, which can help
    investors gain access to asset classes and risks that they may not have
    otherwise had the ability to invest in.


    2) **Increased Liquidity** - The tokenization of assets can provide
    increased liquidity for otherwise illiquid assets. This can in turn help
    finance small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the real economy. This can
    make markets more efficient and help diversify investor risks.


    ### Improved Financial System 

    1) **Increased Speed and Lower Cost** - With automation in the issuance,
    distribution, and management of securities, as well as securities servicing
    and corporate actions, the entire securities transaction process becomes
    more efficient and cost-effective for both issuers and investors.
    Additionally, the distributed nature of the network with no single point of
    failure, the immutability of the ledger, and the application of cryptography
    make the infrastructure more resilient and safe.

    2) **Transparency**  - Transparency is one of the key benefits that
    blockchain technology can bring to the financial markets. By enhancing
    information recording and sharing, blockchain can help create a more
    transparent market environment, with data that is more accurate and
    reliable. This in turn can help boost investor confidence and make the
    markets more efficient. Additionally, the decentralized nature of blockchain
    can help reduce the risks of fraud and corruption, as well as improve
    auditability.

    3) **Better Regulation** - real-time information about on-chain events can
    help regulators better understand what's happening with specific projects.
    This, in turn, can lead to more informed decision-making when it comes to
    compliance and interactions with those behind the project.

    4) **Settlement and Clearing** - Settlement and clearing can be complex
    processes, especially in traditional financial markets. In these markets,
    central clearing houses act as central counterparties (CCPs) to both sides
    of a trade. This ensures that the trade is matched and executed even if one
    of the parties defaults, which reduces counterparty risk. Clearing houses
    confirm trade data and use central securities depositories (CSDs) to record
    transactions. Custodians holding investor assets work with CSDs to ensure
    the safe delivery/transfer of assets and funds to each of the respective
    transacting parties, and they handle the settlement of transactions.
    Blockchain technology can greatly improve efficiency in the settlement
    process by reducing complexity and shortening the settlement cycle to near
    real-time.
- key: downsides-of-tokenization
  shortTitle: Downsides
  details: >
    While tokenization has many potential benefits, including innovation,
    efficiency, security and enhanced liquidity, it also has some potential
    downsides.


    * **Complexity**: Tokenization can be a complex process, requiring technical
    expertise and specialized knowledge of blockchain technology. There is a
    steep learning curve on both the token issuer and the user side. The first
    step of getting started with  blockchain is setting up a wallet and getting
    some funds in, which in itself can be a very complex task for non technical
    users.


    * **Security risks**: Your tokens are always at risk of being lost if you
    forget your private key or if someone gets access to it. Since the
    cryptocurrency industry is not regulated, there are no checks by any
    government authority. In 2022, we saw many customers lose their funds as
    many exchanges were using customer's tokens for riskier bets without their
    consent.


    * **Regulation**: Tokenization is a new and unregulated area, which can
    create uncertainty and potential legal issues. Until the technology and
    tokens themselves are regulated, it cannot get investment from some of the
    biggest institutions like pension funds etc.


    * **High transaction fees**: Tokenization can be a great way for fractional
    ownership or getting liquidity, but it's important to be aware of the
    potential fees involved. When transacting on Bitcoin or Ethereum, for
    example, you may have to pay transaction fees. In contrast, many simple
    transactions made through centralized banks are free of charge.
    Additionally, banks often profit from hidden fees - which is not typically
    the case in decentralized finance.
