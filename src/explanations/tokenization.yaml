    A Token can be thought of as a representation of value that can be exchanged
    or traded in most cases.


    There are many different types of tokens:

    1) **Coins/AltCoins** - These are native to blockchain and can be used for
    payments or to power transactions. The most 
       famous type of coins are Bitcoin(BTC) and Ethereum(ETH). These are normally awarded to the validators of the 
       transaction, but can also be bought and exchanged.
    2) **Security tokens** -  are digital assets that represent some type of
    underlying asset, equity, or commodity. There are many different types of
    security tokens, including:

       1) **Stocks or Bonds** - These tokens represent an underlying stock or bond. They help investors from any country gain exposure to one of the most famous stocks or bonds.

       2) **Commodities** - These tokens represent a commodity, such as gold or oil. They help investors from any country gain exposure to the commodity market.

       3) **Real Estate** - These tokens represent a piece of property. They help investors from any country gain exposure to the real estate market.
    3) **Protocol/product tokens** - these tokens are issued by a protocol and
    may or may not have any utility or governance power related to them.
    Examples of these tokens include MKR, AAVE and COMP. 

    4) **Utility Tokens** - they can serve any purpose that a developer wants
    them to. In general, utility tokens provide access to a specific service or
    product within a blockchain ecosystem. They can often be the same as the
    protocol token or can be different. 

    5) **Governance Tokens** - Governance tokens are primarily used for voting
    and decision-making within a protocol or organization. They may also offer
    some financial incentives, but their main purpose is to give token holders a
    say in how the protocol or organization is run.

    6) **Cause-Based Tokens** - they are designed to support a specific cause or
    charity. They typically don't offer any financial incentives or utility, but
    are meant to show support for the cause they represent. 

    7) **NFTs** - NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a type of cryptocurrency
    that is limited in supply and has a unique identity. NFTs are difficult to
    copy or replicate, making them ideal for representing digital or real-world
    assets such as paintings, photographs, or other materials.
