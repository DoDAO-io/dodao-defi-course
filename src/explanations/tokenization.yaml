    A Token can be thought of as a representation of value that can be exchanged
    or traded in most cases.


    There are many different types of tokens:

    1) **Coins/AltCoins** - These are native to blockchain and can be used for
    payments or to power transactions. The most 
       famous type of coins are Bitcoin(BTC) and Ethereum(ETH). These are normally awarded to the validators of the 
       transaction, but can also be bought and exchanged.
    2) **Security tokens** -  are digital assets that represent some type of
    underlying asset, equity, or commodity. There are many different types of
    security tokens, including:

       1) **Stocks or Bonds** - These tokens represent an underlying stock or bond. They help investors from any country gain exposure to one of the most famous stocks or bonds.

       2) **Commodities** - These tokens represent a commodity, such as gold or oil. They help investors from any country gain exposure to the commodity market.

       3) **Real Estate** - These tokens represent a piece of property. They help investors from any country gain exposure to the real estate market.
    3) **Protocol/product tokens** - these tokens are issued by a protocol and
    may or may not have any utility or governance power related to them.
    Examples of these tokens include MKR, AAVE and COMP. 

    4) **Utility Tokens** - they can serve any purpose that a developer wants
    them to. In general, utility tokens provide access to a specific service or
    product within a blockchain ecosystem. They can often be the same as the
    protocol token or can be different. 

    5) **Governance Tokens** - Governance tokens are primarily used for voting
    and decision-making within a protocol or organization. They may also offer
    some financial incentives, but their main purpose is to give token holders a
    say in how the protocol or organization is run.

    6) **Cause-Based Tokens** - they are designed to support a specific cause or
    charity. They typically don't offer any financial incentives or utility, but
    are meant to show support for the cause they represent. 

    7) **NFTs** - NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a type of cryptocurrency
    that is limited in supply and has a unique identity. NFTs are difficult to
    copy or replicate, making them ideal for representing digital or real-world
    assets such as paintings, photographs, or other materials.


    For asset or equity-backed tokens, there is usually a custodian and an
    investment institution involved in the process of creating a tokenized
    stock, assets or commodities. The institution buys the underlying stock and
    deposits it with the custodian. Based on the number of shares that the
    custodian holds in reserve, tokens are issued on a blockchain. The price of
    each token is pegged to the value of the shares.This process allows for a
    more efficient way of buying and selling stocks or assets, as well as a more
    secure way of storing them. By using a blockchain, there is no need for a
    third party to keep track of ownership or transactions. This makes the
    process more transparent and less susceptible to fraud.


    In 2022, many cryptocurrency exchanges went bankrupt because the tokens they
    were holding were not kept isolated. These exchanges were centralized
    entities that were built on top of decentralized technology, and they didn't
    disclose whether or not users' funds were backed 1:1 at all times. As an
    educated blockchain user, we should be aware whenever we are depositing
    custody of our assets or tokens to anyone else.

    Traditional finance models and tools have worked well until the last few
    years, but they leave a lot to be desired when it comes to offering
    compensation for new ways of collaboration or providing access to a global
    financial system for everyone. Let's take a look at some of the areas where
    traditional finance falls short:


    Compensation - With the traditional ways of compensating employees through
    salaries or stocks, many organizations are now finding it difficult to keep
    up with the changing demands of the workforce. With more people working
    remotely and for fewer hours each week, the rigid financial structures of
    traditional companies are no longer able to keep up. However, in the world
    of cryptocurrency, one can simply write a few lines of code to create and
    distribute tokens based on whatever rules they want. This flexibility has
    already led to some incredible changes in the way we compensate team members
