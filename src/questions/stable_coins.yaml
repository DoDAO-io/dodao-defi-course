  explanation: Conventional fiat-backed stablecoin issuer needs a centralized banking system in order to back the token with real Fiat money, such as USD. The level of centralization that resulted, together with the fact that some fiat-backed stablecoins lacked information on the fiat reserves held in bank accounts, helped on-chain and crypto-backed stablecoins like MakerDAO's Dai to take off.
