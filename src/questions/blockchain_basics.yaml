  hint: Double Spend means copying and reselling the same digital asset many number of times.
  explanation: The first transaction would be approved via the confirmation mechanism and then verified into the subsequent block. However, the second transaction would be recognized as invalid by the confirmation process and would not be verified. If both transactions are pulled from the pool for confirmation simultaneously, the transaction with the highest number of confirmations will be included in the blockchain, while the other one will be discarded.
