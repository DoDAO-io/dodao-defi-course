    ### What is an Exchange?
      An exchange is a marketplace or platform where securities (such as stocks, bonds, preferred shares, ETFs, etc.), commodities, derivatives, and other financial instruments are traded (i.e buying and selling among customers).
      An exchange's primary duty is to ensure fair and orderly trading as well as the efficient broadcast of price information for any securities traded on that exchange. Exchanges provide a forum for firms, governments, and other organisations to offer securities to the investing public.
      An exchange can be either a physical facility where traders gather to do business or an electronic platform. Depending on where you live, they may also be referred to as a stock exchange or "bourse." Most countries throughout the world have exchanges. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, London Stock Exchange (LSE), and Tokyo Stock Exchange are among the more notable exchanges (TSE).
      Exchanges can be subdivided: 
      - By objects sold or traded: Stock exchange, Crypto exchange, Commodities exchange, or Foreign exchange market. 
      - By type of trade: Classical exchange, Future & Options exchange.

      Let us dive into crypto exchanges.

    ### What is a Crypto Exchange?
      Crypto or cryptocurrency or digital-currency exchange is a marketplace or platform which allows customers to trade cryptocurrencies for other assets, such as conventional fiat money(eg: U.S. Dollar, Japanese Yen, Euro, etc.) or other digital currencies.
      On a crypto exchange, you can use ordinary fiat currency to buy crypto, or you may be able to trade one crypto for another. You may be able to convert your crypto back into regular currency, leave it in your account for future trades, or withdraw it as cash. They display the current market value of the cryptocurrencies they provide. Available services can vary, depending on the exchange or app you use. For example, some services don’t allow you to move your crypto off platform to your own crypto wallet. Unlike traditional exchanges that have set trading hours, cryptocurrency exchanges are active 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
      
      In addition to trading services, crypto exchanges provide price discovery through trading activity and crypto storage. Prior to crypto exchanges, consumers could only obtain cryptocurrency through mining or organizing transactions in various online and offline communities.

      There are Centralized and Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchanges, and each offers advantages and disadvantages.

  key: centralized

    ### Traditional or Centralized Exchange (CEX):
      A centralized exchange is a peer-to-exchange-to-peer marketplace where transactions between crypto traders are done using traditional “Order Book” models that are officiated by banks, brokers, or any other intermediary. Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges serve as a middleman between buyers and sellers and generate revenue through commissions and transaction fees. You may think of a CEX as a stock exchange for digital assets.
      Coinbase, Crypto.com, Gemini, and Binance are well-known cryptocurrency exchanges. These exchanges let cryptocurrency investors buy and sell digital assets at the current price, known as spot, or leave orders that get executed when the asset reaches the investor's preferred price objective, known as limit orders, in a manner similar to stock trading websites or applications.
      Exchanges choose which digital assets to allow trading in, providing some reassurance that dishonest digital assets may be barred. They also set exchange rules and fees as well as store customer data (such as KYC) and transactional data.
      Since one of the core principles of cryptocurrencies is that they are decentralized, or not issued or regulated by a government or other central body, this may seem nonsensical. However, a centralized cryptocurrency exchange might make it simpler to purchase the cryptocurrency you want using fiat money.
      Some centralized exchanges may be more susceptible to assault because they are held by a single party, which poses a potential risk.

      * Now, What is an “Order Book”?
        * An order book is a list of orders that presents different offers from buyers and sellers for a specific security.
        * It also shows the prices and volumes that people in the market are willing to buy and sell the security for.
      * There are two types of CEX based on the order book model:
        - CEX with Server Order Book model:
          * All the customers’ trading data, prices, and volumes of securities are stored in a Centralized Server.
          * Trade matching and settlement are faster.
          * No fees are deducted for canceled orders.
          * No censorship resistance as all data are stored on a centralized server.
          * Exchange operators can front-run customers.

        - CEX with Onchain Order Book model
          * All the customers’ trading data, prices, and volumes of securities are stored on a Blockchain.
          * Provide censorship resistance, as all data are stored on a distributed, and decentralized ledger in the form of immutable data blocks on the blockchain which are publicly shared among all its network nodes.
          * Trade matching and settlement might be slow due to blockchain scalability issues.
          * Fees are deducted in the form of Gas Fees for both successful and canceled orders.
          * Miner/Trader/Exchange Operator can front-run users.

- title: Decentralized Exchange (DEX)
  shortTitle: DEX definition
  key: dex-definition
  details: |
    - Decentralized Exchange (DEX)
      * A peer-to-peer marketplace where transactions between crypto traders are done mostly using Automated Market Maker (AMM) without banks, brokers, or any other intermediary intervention.
      * Customer, transactional, and all other forms of data are stored on Blockchain. 
      * Eg: Uniswap, dYdX (which runs on Ethereum Blockchain)

      - Pros
        * No KYC is required as trades are done in terms of account address 
        * No fees are paid to the exchange.
        * No impermanent loss (this will be discussed later in this course)
        * Censorship resistance is governed by Smart Contracts and not by any central authority

      - Cons
        * Fees (i.e Gas Fee) are deducted as an additional charge for a deposit, withdrawal, or trade creation/cancelation.
        * Trade settlement might be slow due to blockchain scalability issues. 
        * Sometimes, not fully decentralized due to mediating server for speeding the process of trade execution.

- title: Automated Market Maker (AMM)
  shortTitle: AMM
  key: amm
  details: |
    - Automated Market Maker (AMM):
      * AMM is a type of DEX protocol that relies on a mathematical formula that allows digital assets to be traded without permission, automatically by using liquidity pools instead of the traditional order book pricing model. This formula can vary with each protocol. For example, Uniswap uses the Constant Product AMM protocol which is as follows:-
        * Asset X quantity * Asset Y quantity = K (a constant)  simply  X*Y=K
          * Properties of popular Constant Product AMM protocol:
            * Instant liquidity, irrespective of the trade size (assuming that trade size is always less than pool size).
            * Purchase of asset X increases the price of X and decreases the price of Y
            * The ratio of assets X and Y sets the price
        * Now, What is a Protocol?
          * Protocols are basic sets of rules that allow data and cryptocurrencies to be shared securely between different nodes (i.e computers) in the blockchain network.
        - Pros of an AMM:
            * No Order Book Maintenance for traders but arbitrage is required for them.
            * A simple implementation of Constant Product AMM causes less computation which results in Low gas costs.
        - Cons of an AMM:
            * The danger of Impermanent loss/Coin De-Pegg may cause a total possible loss of funds in Liquidity Pools.
            * High slippage for low liquidity markets. So, please do observe and set your slippage tolerance threshold level while trading.

- title: Liquidity Pool
  shortTitle: Liquidity Pool
  key: liquidity-pool
  details: |
    - Liquidity Pool and its Working:-
      * A Liquidity Pool is a collection of two asset pairs X and Y (Let’s say for example in the case of Constant Product AMM), funded by Liquidity Providers(LP), that are locked in a smart contract, to facilitate trading, borrowing, lending, yielding, etc.
      * It ensures that buy and sell orders are carried out no matter the time of the day and at whatever price you want to trade without looking for any direct counterpart(as in the case of Order Book) as AMM ensures this. Hence, we won’t need to find a seller to buy a token. All that is needed is sufficient liquidity in the pool.
      * When a token swap occurs, the AMM ensures that the price adjusts based on its algorithm. The algorithm ensures that there is always liquidity in the pool, no matter the trade size. 
      * For eg., A liquidity pool is, by default, a 50:50 ratio of 2 coins. Let's say 50% dai (DAI) and 50% ether (ETH). When you buy DAI with ETH, the pools will start to lose DAI and get more ETH. The algorithm increases the price of dai and lowers the price of ether to keep the ratio regulated. The process is a self-regulated automated reaction to the market's needs.

  shortTitle: Liquidity Providers
  key: liquidity-providers
  details: |
    - Types of rewards that Liquidity Providers get on funding Liquidity Pools are:
      - Trading Fees reward: that are paid by traders on each trade( eg, 0.03% in Curve.fi )
      - Liquidity Mining reward:
        * It is an incentive/reward given to the Liquidity Providers(LP) proportional to the amount of liquidity provided by the LP
        * It can also be provided to the LPs in terms of “Airdrops”.
        * Airdrops are tokens that are given to the traders and LPs for free or in exchange for minimal promotional work.
    - Types of losses for Liquidity Providers:
      - Impermanent loss == Not Permanent Loss
        * Impermanent Loss arises when the price ratio of an asset and liquidity pool changes. So, Liquidity Providers (LPs) who have deposited funds in affected pools automatically incur this loss. The larger the shift in the price ratio the larger the loss.
        * However, this loss is called impermanent for a reason as long as we do not withdraw deposited tokens at a time that the pool is experiencing a shift in price ratio it is still possible to mitigate the loss.
        * This loss disappears when the prices of the tokens revert to the original value at which they were deposited.
        * Those who withdraw funds before the prices revert suffer permanent losses.
        - Nonetheless, it is possible to negate the losses through income received by liquidity providers via:
          * Trading fees (i.e fees taken from traders during each trading transaction).
          * Liquidity mining reward (i.e reward given by the DEX in the form of its governance tokens or some other asset as interests).
      - Coin de-peg:
        * De-pegging refers to the phenomenon of a stablecoin deviating or any asset deviating from its intended peg. For example: In the case of a stablecoin pegged to USD, if its value reduces below $1, then the coin is said to be “de-pegged” which indirectly reduces the valuation of investment to a Liquidity Pool by a Liquidity Provider.

    * How traders are making profits using AMM?
      - Arbitrage:
        * It is an investment strategy in which an investor (a.k.a. Arbitrageurs) simultaneously buys and sells the same asset in different markets(either AMM or some other market) to profit from tiny differences in the asset's listed price.
      - Flash Swaps or Capital Free Arbitrage (used in Uniswap):
        * It allows us to withdraw up to the full reserves of any ERC20 token on Uniswap and execute arbitrary logic at no upfront cost, provided that by the end of the transaction you either:
          * Pay for the withdrawn ERC20 tokens with the corresponding pair tokens
          * Return the withdrawn ERC20 tokens along with a small fee
    * One thing that causes the most loss to traders:-
      - Slippage:
        * The featured price of a cryptocurrency on a marketplace is the most recent price at which that cryptocurrency was bought by the buyer or sold by the seller. So in some cases where there are not enough counter-parties to trade with, then the market is said to be illiquid or prone to slippage.
        * It occurs when the processing of large order volumes drives the prices of an asset up or down to mitigate this occurrence and this fluctuation of price is called volatility.
        * In other words, Slippage is the difference between the expected price of an order and the price when the order executes. ( due to the volatility of cryptocurrency prices )
        * For solving this illiquidity or slippage problem of the market we need liquidity which is provided by Liquidity Providers (or Market Makers) to make Liquidity Pools liquid again and this whole process is called Market Making.

    - DEX Aggregators:
      DEX Aggregators are financial protocols that enable cryptocurrency traders to access a range of trading pools from a single dashboard (i.e Aggregates different Liquidity Pool prices at one Place).
      - Types of Aggregators:-
        - Off-chain Aggregator ( like 1inch, paraswap )
          * (+) Can swap multiple chains flexibly present over 4+ exchanges
          * (-) An operator can front-run users
        - On-chain Aggregator ( like swapswap )
          * (+) used for arbitrage findings
          * (-) unlikely to efficiently cover 4+ exchanges
